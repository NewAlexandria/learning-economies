# TRETC 2026 Presentation: Learning Economies

This folder contains materials for the **TRETC 2026** presentation on "Learning Economies: Transforming Education in the AI Era" - a framework for understanding how AI accelerates different modes of learning and human capital creation.

## Presentation Overview

**Title:** Accelerate workforce readiness by leveraging ML for adaptive learning

**Format:** 30-minute Listen & Learn Presentation (with option for 60-minute interactive session)

**Conference:** TRETC 2026 (Technology & Engineering Education Conference)

**Audience:**
- High School Educators (9-12)
- Computer Science Educators
- IT Directors
- Students
- EdTech Leaders

## Core Framework: Five Learning Economies

The presentation introduces a taxonomy of **five fundamental Learning Economies** that represent distinct modes of value creation through knowledge acquisition:

1. **Breadth** - Multi-subject mastery and parallel domain competency
2. **Depth** - Time-to-competence optimization and acceleration
3. **Subset** - Career mobility through rapid retraining
4. **Superset** - Field reinvention and creative destruction
5. **Network-form** - Multi-scale knowledge routing and synthesis

**Key Concept:** **Resonance** - the universal transfer mechanism enabling cross-domain knowledge flow and synthesis across all five economies.

## Presentation Objectives

- Provide a practical roadmap for leveraging AI in the classroom
- Design measurements for learning across different economies
- Explore how AI can support educators with templates and frameworks
- Demonstrate adaptive measures of students' development of critical thinking skills
- Accelerate the development of industry competencies for a rapidly changing world

## Key Concepts

### The Five Learning Economies in Detail

**Breadth Economy:**
- Multi-subject/multi-degree mastery
- Portfolio breadth as new metric
- Parallel intellectual pipelines
- Metrics: diversity index, parallel domains, time to proficiency

**Depth Economy:**
- Acceleration to mastery
- Time-to-competence optimization
- AI scaffolding removes bottlenecks
- Metrics: shortest time to PhD-level mastery, hours to independent problem-solving

**Subset Economy:**
- Vocational/career re-training
- Real-time vocational retraining
- Career pivots compressed to months/weeks
- **Example:** ASU Microcredentials model
- Metrics: distinct fields mastered, retraining time, career pivot success rate

**Superset Economy:**
- Field reinvention/obviation
- Creative destruction of entire fields
- Historical examples: Jacquard loom, GPS, digital photography
- Metrics: fields obsoleted, time to replacement, economic impact

**Network-form Economy:**
- Multi-scale knowledge routing
- Connecting micro-details to macro-patterns
- AI optimizes cross-scale connections
- Metrics: scale traversals, compression ratio, emergent property discovery

### Resonance: The Universal Transfer Mechanism

**Resonance enables:**
- **Subset Mobility:** Skills transfer between domains (e.g., statistical thinking: physics → finance → marketing)
- **Superset Disruption:** Synthesis across domains creates field reinvention (e.g., digital photography: electronics + optics + chemistry)
- **Network-form Navigation:** Cross-scale connections (e.g., molecular biology → ecosystem dynamics)

**AI amplifies Resonance by:**
- Making cross-domain patterns more visible
- Surfacing non-obvious transfer opportunities
- Enabling synthesis across domains and scales

### AI as Learning Accelerator

**What AI Does:**
- Accelerates existing Learning Economy principles (10-100x speed increase)
- Provides differential capabilities: speed, scale, pattern recognition
- Optimizes multi-scale granule routing
- Generates dynamic pathways between knowledge domains

**What AI Doesn't Do:**
- Create fundamentally new learning economies
- Replace human cross-domain pattern recognition
- Eliminate need for meta-competencies

## Alignment with NIST 800-181 (NICE Framework)

The presentation and implementation framework align with:
- **NIST 800-181:** Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework)
- **KSA Structure:** Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities
- **Testable Statements:** Measurable interventions
- **Work Roles:** Cybersecurity workforce roles and competencies

See the main repository's [NIST-800-181-testable-templates.md](../NIST-800-181-testable-templates.md) for 14 testable hypotheses aligned with the NICE Framework.

## Implementation Resources

### Teacher Kit (In Development)

The presentation includes development of an **open-source training kit** for educators:

**Components:**
- Standalone model or agent-chat interface
- Prompt templates for asking path questions
- Pedagogical frameworks
- Curriculum templates
- Testing/scoring alignment to Learning Economies

**Workshop Format:**
- Guided chat usage
- Interactive demonstrations
- Hands-on practice with Learning Economies framework

### Service Architecture

A proposed online service would coordinate agentic support for teachers and students:
- Help students identify alignment with different Learning Economies
- Support teachers in developing personalized education plans
- Connect students to relevant testable hypotheses
- Facilitate Learning Economies agent conversations

See the main repository's [learning-economies-service-demo.md](../learning-economies-service-demo.md) for details.
