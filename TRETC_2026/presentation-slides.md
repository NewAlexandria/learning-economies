# Basis of 'Learning Economies'

---

# AI Transforms Learning and Value Creation {layout="Title and Content"}

- **Linear progression** through single domains - problem in traditional models
- **Multidisciplinarity** challenges yet strengthens learning approaches
- **10-100x acceleration** across knowledge areas
- **Credentialing systems** become obsolete as velocity increases

---

# What Are "Learning Economies"? {layout="Title and Content"}

- LLM has a bias based on training
- Design curricula and Edu support to work with the bias
    - example: ontology hydrations for cyber assets vs. flow
    - think of a coin sorting machine that has no slot for dimes.

Speed to learning can be very fast.

# LLM Architecture {layout="Title and Content"}

Go with the grain: LLM architecture -> learning

- **Addressing** → Multidisciplinarity.
- **Compression** → Conceptual leaps, connections.
- **Routing** → Concept linkage and context.
- **Temperature** → Inspiration and creativity.
- **Stabilization** → Loop between Educator and Learner.
- **Transformers** → Non-linearity and new structures.

2. **Depth** - Time-to-competence optimization and acceleration
3. **Subset** - Career mobility through rapid retraining
4. **Superset** - Field reinvention and creative restructuring
5. **'Network-form'** - Multi-scale knowledge routing and synthesis

# Institutional Challenges

**The Credential Lag Problem**

**Current Issues:**

- Traditional institutions validate competencies after AI has accelerated past those benchmarks
- Single-threaded degree programs become inadequate

**Progressive Responses:**

- Partner directly with AI systems for continuous assessment
- Create "learning velocity leagues" competing on acceleration metrics
- Develop expertise in meta-learning across all five economies

**Survival Strategy:** Become **Learning Economy Orchestrators** rather than knowledge repositories.
