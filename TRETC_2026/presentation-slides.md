# Basis of 'Learning Economies'

---

::: {.optional}
# AI Transforms Learning and Value Creation {layout="Title and Content"}

- **Linear progression** through single domains - problem in traditional models
- **Multidisciplinarity** challenges yet strengthens learning approaches
- **10-100x acceleration** across knowledge areas
- **Credentialing systems** become obsolete as velocity increases
:::

# What Are "Learning Economies"? {layout="Title and Content"}

- LLM has a bias based on training
- Design curricula and Edu support to work with the bias
    - example: ontology hydrations for cyber assets vs. flow
    - think of a coin sorting machine that has no slot for dimes.

Speed to learning can be very fast.

# LLM Architecture {layout="Title and Content"}

Go with the grain: LLM architecture -> learning

- **Addressing** → Multidisciplinarity.
- **Compression** → Conceptual leaps, connections.
- **Routing** → Concept linkage and context.
- **Temperature** → Inspiration and creativity.
- **Stabilization** → Loop between Educator and Learner.
- **Transformers** → Non-linearity and new structures.

# The Four Learning Economies Framework

**New taxonomy for learning**

2. **Depth** - Time-to-competence optimization and acceleration
3. **Subset** - Career mobility through rapid retraining
4. **Superset** - Field reinvention and creative restructuring

---

# The Breadth Economy: Multi-Subject / Multi-Degree Mastery

::::: columns
::: column
**Current State:**

- Broad exposure required (high school)
- Single-field depth emphasis (undergrad)
- GPA measures breadth navigation


:::
::: column
**AI-Accelerated Future:**

- **Double/triple majors** → **4-5 simultaneous**
- Multiple degrees acquired simultaneously
- Portfolio breadth as primary metric
- **LLM routing** between knowledge domains
- **Temperature** creates crossover between segments
:::
:::::

::: notes
**Metrics:**

# Resonance - The Universal Transfer Mechanism

**How knowledge flows between economies**

**Resonance enables:**

- **Superset Disruption:** Digital photography emerged from electronics + optics + chemistry synthesis
- **Network-form Navigation:** Molecular biology insights connect to ecosystem dynamics

**AI Amplifies Resonance by:**

- Making cross-domain patterns more visible
- Surfacing non-obvious transfer opportunities
- Enabling synthesis across domains and scales

**Key Insight:** Resonance isn't just "skill transfer"—it's recognition of deep structural similarities that allow knowledge to flow and recombine.
