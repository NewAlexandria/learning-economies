## Title

Accelerate workforce readiness by leveraging ML for adaptive learning

## Description / Abstract

This talk proposes a novel approach to AI-enabled learning models, which uncover efficiencies and economics of the learning process.  We will discuss how this open the doors to a new approach to student learning.

By leveraging ML structures intrinsic to AI, we can facilitate student learning in ways that have historically been inaccessible. Similar to how LLMs process information, these structures can translate into new learning dynamics and efficiencies. Thus: Learning Economies.

We will approach this topic from the perspective of Cybersecurity practitioner and educators. The NIST 800-181 structure, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) and development, includes KSA (knowledge skills abilities), testable statements, measures, and related roles.

We will cover four (4) pillars of Learning Economies: depth, breath, granular, and emergent. The first three bear comparison to traditional learning paths of PhD research programs, multi-degree programs, and vocational programs.

This presentation will explore the value in actively engaging AI technology to enhance educators' ability to deliver outcomes across an increasingly diverse body of students and adaptive programs.  AI can support educators with templates, and frameworks, that provide adaptive measures of students' development of critical thinking skills. This approach is especially important for accelerating the development of industry competencies for a rapidly changing world.

## Objectives

A practical roadmap for leveraging AI in the classroom, and design measurements for learning

## Format

30 minutes: Listen & Learn Presentation

## Audience

- High School Educators (9-12)
- Computer Science Educators
- IT Directors
- Students
- EdTech Leaders
- Administrators

## TRETC 2026 categories

Each presentation categorized under the following tracks – Please identify which 1-3 your presentation best fits:

- Career Readiness/Career Connections
- Cybersecurity Workforce & Pathways
- Instructional Pedagogy/Scaffolding

## Collaboration

A training kit that we are developing will be open-source for others to use, with the option to conduct workshops.

## Notes to Reviewers

We think that the 30 minute presentation format will work well for this, but we seek your feedback about doing the 60-minute interactive session format. We are developing an agentic tool that supports teachers and students in the acceleration of the learners' personalized educational program. We could demo this in an interactive manner.
