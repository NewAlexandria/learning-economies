# Learning Economies Repository

This repository contains research and documentation on the transformation of human capital and educational systems in the era of artificial intelligence. The work presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding how AI accelerates different modes of learning and value creation.

## Overview

The core contribution is a taxonomy of **five fundamental Learning Economies** that represent distinct modes of value creation through knowledge acquisition and application:

1. **Breadth** - diversification across multiple domains
2. **Depth** - acceleration of mastery within fields
3. **Subset** - vocational mobility through rapid retraining
4. **Superset** - creative destruction through field-level reinvention
5. **Network-form** - value creation through multi-scale knowledge routing

Central to this framework is **Resonance** - the universal transfer mechanism enabling cross-domain knowledge flow and synthesis across all five economies.

## Repository Contents

### Core Research Documents

#### 📄 [AI and Learning Economics - Five Economies of Human Capital in the AI Era](./2025-09-14-AI-learning-economics.md)

**Main theoretical framework document**

This comprehensive paper presents the foundational theory of Learning Economies, examining how AI transforms human capital and educational systems. Key contributions include:

- **Taxonomy of Five Learning Economies**: Detailed analysis of Breadth, Depth, Subset, Superset, and Network-form economies
- **Resonance as Transfer Mechanism**: How cross-domain knowledge flow enables learning mobility
- **AI as Learning Accelerator**: Analysis of how AI amplifies existing economic principles rather than creating new ones
- **Economic Implications**: Labor market transformations, new forms of knowledge capital, and systemic effects
- **Practical Applications**: Implications for learners, educators, and policymakers

The document includes extensive historical examples, metrics for each economy, and a unified production function for learning value.

#### 📄 [NIST-800-181 Testable Templates](./NIST-800-181-testable-templates.md)

**Implementation framework aligned with NICE cybersecurity workforce standards**

This document translates the Learning Economies theory into testable hypotheses using the NIST 800-181 (NICE) framework. It provides:

- **14 Testable Hypotheses**: Concrete, measurable interventions for each Learning Economy and meta-factor
- **NICE Framework Alignment**: Maps to cybersecurity workforce roles and competencies
- **Quantitative Measures**: Specific metrics, data sources, and success criteria
- **Evaluation Protocols**: RCT designs, statistical methods, and ethical considerations

Each hypothesis includes Work Role/Category, testable statements, population/intervention/comparator groups, and measurable outcomes suitable for pilot studies or A/B tests.

### Project Planning Documents

#### 📄 [Learning Economies Service Demo](./learning-economies-service-demo.md)

**Service architecture overview**

A high-level description of an online service that would coordinate agentic support for teachers and students using the Learning Economies framework. The service would:

- Help students identify their alignment with different Learning Economies
- Support teachers in developing personalized education plans
- Connect students to relevant testable hypotheses
- Facilitate Learning Economies agent conversations

_Note: This document is marked as highly incomplete and needs expansion._

#### 📄 [Hypothesis Structure Design](./hypothesis-structure-design.md)

**Template for hypothesis formulation**

A structured format for creating testable hypotheses, including:

- Work Role/Category and Specialty Area
- Testable statements
- Population/Intervention/Comparator definitions
- Quantitative measures and data sources
- Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) targeted
- Related tasks and success criteria

_Note: This document contains TODO items and needs additional context._

### Presentation and Proposal Materials

#### 📄 [TRETC Presentation Scope](./TRETC-presentation-scope.md)

**Presentation outline**

Brief outline for a presentation covering:

- AI corporate ecosystem interconnection mapping
- Bubble vs non-bubble analysis
- Additional topics (marked as incomplete)

#### 📄 [TRETC Proposal](./TRETC-proposal.md)

**Proposal summary**

Short proposal for creating a demo of the Learning Economies system, noting the need to scope the ontology of curriculum.

#### 📄 [ASU Microcredential Model: Subset Economy Example](./ASU-microcredential-subset-economy.md)

**Real-world implementation of the Subset Learning Economy**

Detailed analysis of Arizona State University's microcredential model as a practical implementation of Subset Economy principles:

- **Modular, stackable credentials** supporting career transitions
- **Rapid retraining** compressed from years to months
- **Industry-aligned, digitally-badged** competencies
- **Clear pathways** to larger credentials
- **Lifelong learning** adaptation for working professionals

This document provides concrete evidence that the Subset economy is already being implemented successfully, offering a roadmap for other institutions.

#### 📄 [Work in Progress Notes](./WIP_notes.md)

**Research notes and observations**

Collection of research notes covering:

- Chinese vs US education strategies and breadth approaches
- Social media influence on learning motivation
- Cost and value models for degree programs
- Student outcome tracking
- Curriculum design principles
- Relationship to NIST standards (800-161 and 800-181)
- ASU microcredential system as Subset economy model

## Key Concepts

### Learning Economies Framework

**Core Economies:**

- **Breadth**: Multi-subject mastery and parallel domain competency
- **Depth**: Time-to-competence optimization and acceleration
- **Subset**: Career mobility through rapid retraining
- **Superset**: Field reinvention and creative destruction
- **Network-form**: Multi-scale knowledge routing and synthesis

**Meta-Factors:**

- **Resonance**: Cross-domain transfer mechanism
- **Scaffolding**: Structured learning supports
- **Amplification**: Learning speed acceleration
- **Compression**: Dense knowledge representation
- **Redundancy**: Overlapping skills for resilience
- **Liquidity**: Knowledge asset convertibility
- **Inheritance**: Intergenerational knowledge transfer

### AI's Role

Rather than creating a new "symbiosis" learning economy, AI serves as an **accelerator** of existing Learning Economy principles through:

- Differential capabilities in speed, scale, and pattern recognition
- Multi-scale granule routing optimization
- Dynamic pathway generation between knowledge domains
- Personalized topology adaptation

## Applications

### For Educators

- Design experiences that develop competency across all five economies
- Strengthen Resonance capabilities in students
- Transition from knowledge transmission to Learning Economy Architecture

### For Learners

- Become Learning Economy Orchestrators
- Develop meta-competencies in economy navigation
- Master fluid movement between learning modes

### For Policymakers

- Focus on Learning Economy Infrastructure development
- Build institutional foundations for rapid learning acceleration
- Create competitive advantage through learning velocity
