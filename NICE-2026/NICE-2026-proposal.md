# NICE Conference & Expo 2026 Proposal

## Session Title

Accelerating Cybersecurity Workforce Readiness Through AI-Enabled Learning Economies

(10 words)

## Session Description

This session introduces Learning Economies, a novel AI-enabled approach to cybersecurity workforce development that leverages machine learning structures to optimize the human learning process. We explore how AI can transform traditional cybersecurity education by uncovering new efficiencies and learning dynamics.

We demonstrate how the NIST 800-181 Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) can be enhanced through AI-driven adaptive learning, similar to how large language models process information. The framework's KSA (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities) structure, testable statements, measures, and role definitions provide a foundation for evaluating Learning Economies.

We present the types of Learning Economies — depth, breadth, granular, and emergent — that map to traditional learning paths. Attendees will learn how LLM-native structures may support more efficient use of AI in education. We explore templates and frameworks that provide adaptive measures of students' development of critical thinking skills and industry competencies, essential for preparing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.

## Session Outline

Basis of Learning Economies

- How AI accelerates learning and transforms cybersecurity workforce development
- Learning Economies defined; basis in AI models
- Connection to KSA structure and testable statements

The Learning Economies Framework

- Five economies: Breadth (multi-domain), Depth (acceleration), Subset (retraining), Superset (field reinvention), Network-form (multi-scale routing)
- Transfer mechanism enabling flow between economies
- How AI can amplify

Futurism: Economic Implications

- Labor market transformations when learning velocity increases dramatically
- Institutional challenges: credential lag and the need for Learning Economy Orchestrators
- New forms of knowledge capital and competitive advantage

Guides: Practical Implementation

- Applications for educators: designing experiences across all five economies
- NICE Framework integration: templates, adaptive measurement, and testable hypotheses
- Implementation roadmap and success metrics for cybersecurity workforce development

Going Forward & Q&A

- Call to action: becoming Learning Economy Orchestrators
- Open-source tools and collaboration opportunities
