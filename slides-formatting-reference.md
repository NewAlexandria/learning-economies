# ReadyHub

by Keystone Flow

### AI-Powered Municipal Development Coordination

Pittsburgh Tech Week 2025

---

# Problem Statement

- **Fire, Planning, Engineering, Building** departments don't communicate
- Each speaks different technical language
- Endless revision cycles: 5+ years for projects that could take months
- Developers become ineffective intermediaries between conflicting arms-length mandates

### Every US municipality loses \$400K+ per development project

# Solution

## ReadyHub: "Babel for Decision Makers"

**AI-powered coordination platform that:**

- Translates between department silos
- Validates requirements upfront
- Accelerates side-channels, for risk-averse staff
- Creates institutional memory that support all parties

**Medium-fidelity digital twin** bridges technical languages

# How It Works

1. **Departments input requirements** in their language
2. **AI translates and identifies conflicts** instantly
3. **Stakeholders see unified vision** (including community)
4. **Decisions in weeks, not years**

Leverages existing frameworks: BYOS - bring your own standards.

(from any source, e.g. FEMA maps, building codes, HEC-RAS models, etc)
