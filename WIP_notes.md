# Scope

Accelerate workforce readiness by leveraging ML for adaptive learning

## Collaboration

A training kit that we are developing will be open-source for others to use, with the option to conduct workshops.

## Contacts and Collaborators

## Secondary text

We think that the 30 minute presentation format will work well for this, but we seek your feedback about doing the 60-minute interactive session format.  We are developing an agentic tool that supports teachers and students in the acceleration of the learners' personalized educational program.  We could demo this in an interactive manner.

## chinese education breadth, and US strategy

* tiktok making wrong programming
* value of learn internal drivers from social motivators
* chinese social media push for showing amazing labor techinuqes that are unique stregnth when china-based but would not translate to the US and would lead a US worker to spend years practicing to do that but it not multiplying the value of the US economy

support depth race to PhD per-student

### school programs

cost model for schools charging students
value model of degree programs

track the students and where they go after college

foundational AI labs/companies track progress of students

admins can look at AI as a black box. Magic wands that enables all this

educators need to know how to use the AI tools to support students, at the speed/depth, breadth, subset, superset, network-form

### Methods and protocol

* how to think critically
* how to think across all the breadths

more scientific method and outcome-based strategy for the social sciences
more ethics and behavioral science in the STEM fields

### curriculum == measured outcomes

* student outcomes
* educator outcomes
* institutional outcomes
* community outcomes

2nd and 3rd order outcomes

* policy outcomes
* economic outcomes
* environmental outcomes
* social outcomes
* cultural outcomes
* political outcomes
* ethical outcomes
* legal outcomes
* financial outcomes
* health outcomes
* safety outcomes
* productivity outcomes
* innovation outcomes
* competitiveness outcomes
* sustainability outcomes
* equity outcomes

NIST standards 800-161 refer to the "Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," a publication by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This standard provides comprehensive guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks associated with the supply chain, particularly for federal agencies and organizations handling sensitive information. It outlines best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that arise from third-party vendors, suppliers, and service providers, ensuring the integrity, security, and resilience of information systems throughout their lifecycle.

For cybersecurity education frameworks, the relevant NIST standard is NIST Special Publication 800-181, known as the "National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework." This framework defines the knowledge, skills, abilities, and tasks required for cybersecurity roles and is widely used to guide curriculum development and workforce training in the field.

This action research project examines how AI-supported feedback can improve the use of high-leverage teaching practices as measured by TeachFX. By using TeachFX to analyze teacher talk, wait time, and questioning patterns, the study measures changes in student participation and response quality over time. The project aims to determine whether real-time, data-driven insights help a teacher increase effective instructional moves and create a more engaging, student-centered learning environment.

1. You just came off a very interesting budget discussion of which funding for education was a major focal point. Can you talk about what your priorities were for that budget and key achievements?
2. In a conference focused on educational technology, mental health plays a key role. We know you care deeply about students and mental health. What opportunities do you see for deepening support for student mental health well-being in our schools?
3. As schools across Pennsylvania begin exploring how to responsibly integrate AI tools into teaching, learning, and student supports, what role do you see the legislature playing in helping districts build thoughtful policies around AI-balancing innovation, equity, and student privacy
4. Given the ongoing emphasis on expanding career and technical education and workforce pathways, how do you envision state policy  evolving so that students have meaningful access to those opportunities?
5. Looking ahead, how can educators and legislative leaders work together to sustain momentum for investment in schools?

### LindenAI models

Intuitive Design of an AI System  AI is human knowledge and reasoning (KnR) in usable digital form. Yet, because human knowledge is incredibly diverse and human reasoning is unfathomably arbitrary, there is no universally accepted curriculum on how to teach it. This workshop will introduce some principles and tools by which anyone can specify, intuitively, the design of a non-trivial, real-world AI system, without needing the help of tools such as a large language model (LLM) e.g. ChatGPT, or an agentic AI development framework. Although the design will not be implemented in software, it will provide many insights into what type of AI software will be needed to implement the full system, the amount of effort for an initial implementation, and the type of maintenance an implemented system will likely require.  This workshop will be designed for educators, education administrators, and lay people with expertise they suspect could be automated via AI. After an initial problem motivation, the introduction of some key principles, a quick tutorial on a diagrammatic engineering notation, and the walk through of examples, participants will be encouraged to describe a process of their own, abstractly, in their own terms, and that they would like to automate via AI. The process can be drawn from humanistic material such as cultural anthropology, cultural norms, human teamwork, and sociology, or from traditional STEM fields such as manufacturing, robotics, and industrial arts. Participants will have an opportunity to present their AI system design and receive feedback on it. The instructor will be happy to follow-up with participants after the workshop should there not be enough time to have their designs reviewed during the session.
