# Scope

Accelerate workforce readiness by leveraging ML for adaptive learning


## GuildCon 2205

['chat with paper' as curriculum means](https://chatpaper.com/paper/207336)

## abstract

This talk proposes a novel approach to AI-enabled learning models, which uncover efficiencies and economics of the learning process.  We will discuss how this open the doors to a new approach to student learning.

By leveraging ML structures intrinsic to AI, we can facilitate student learning in ways that have historically been inaccessible. Similar to how LLMs process information, these structures can translate into new learning dynamics and efficiencies. Thus: Learning Economies.

We will approach this topic from the perspective of Cybersecurity practitioner and educators. The NIST 800-181 structure, Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) and development, includes KSA (knowledge skills abilities), testable statements, measures, and related roles.

We will cover four (4) pillars of Learning Economies: depth, breath, granular, and emergent. The first three bear comparison to traditional learning paths of PhD research programs, multi-degree programs, and vocational programs.

This presentation will explore the value in actively engaging AI technology to enhance educators' ability to deliver outcomes across an increasingly diverse body of students and adaptive programs.  AI can support educators with templates, and frameworks, that provide adaptive measures of students' development of critical thinking skills. This approach is especially important for accelerating the development of industry competencies for a rapidly changing world.

## Collaboration

A training kit that we are developing will be open-source for others to use, with the option to conduct workshops.

## Secondary text

We think that the 30 minute presentation format will work well for this, but we seek your feedback about doing the 60-minute interactive session format.  We are developing an agentic tool that supports teachers and students in the acceleration of the learners' personalized educational program.  We could demo this in an interactive manner.

## chinese education breadth, and US strategy

- tiktok making wrong programming
- value of learn internal drivers from social motivators
- chinese social media push for showing amazing labor techinuqes that are unique stregnth when china-based but would not translate to the US and would lead a US worker to spend years practicing to do that but it not multiplying the value of the US economy

support depth race to PhD per-student

### school programs

cost model for schools charging students
value model of degree programs

track the students and where they go after college

foundational AI labs/companies track progress of students

admins can look at AI as a black box. Magic wands that enables all this

educators need to know how to use the AI tools to support students, at the speed/depth, breadth, subset, superset, network-form

### Methods and protocol

- how to think critically
- how to think across all the breadths

more scientific method and outcome-based strategy for the social sciences
more ethics and behavioral science in the STEM fields

### curriculum == measured outcomes

- student outcomes
- educator outcomes
- institutional outcomes
- community outcomes

2nd and 3rd order outcomes

- policy outcomes
- economic outcomes
- environmental outcomes
- social outcomes
- cultural outcomes
- political outcomes
- ethical outcomes
- legal outcomes
- financial outcomes
- health outcomes
- safety outcomes
- productivity outcomes
- innovation outcomes
- competitiveness outcomes
- sustainability outcomes
- equity outcomes

NIST standards 800-161 refer to the "Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," a publication by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This standard provides comprehensive guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks associated with the supply chain, particularly for federal agencies and organizations handling sensitive information. It outlines best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that arise from third-party vendors, suppliers, and service providers, ensuring the integrity, security, and resilience of information systems throughout their lifecycle.

For cybersecurity education frameworks, the relevant NIST standard is NIST Special Publication 800-181, known as the "National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework." This framework defines the knowledge, skills, abilities, and tasks required for cybersecurity roles and is widely used to guide curriculum development and workforce training in the field.
