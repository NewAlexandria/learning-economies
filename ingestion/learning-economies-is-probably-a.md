## Description

Learning economies is probably a good response to this recent request by Dan Schaeffer, Professor of HCI at CMU.

Please generate a post for my LinkedIn feed, talking abuot out work on Learning Economies, and giving a link to the youtube.  Then write a terse concice comment that I"ll post to Dan's requst, to draw his attention to my post (that you just wrote)

Dan's request:

I need your input.

My UI for AI team of CMU Master's students is continuing next semester, but this time we're looking ahead 3-5 years into the future. Before we begin designing anything, we need to forecast some possible AI futures.

Please point me towards articles, talks, near-term scifi, research, etc. so that we can do our homework before diving in and prototyping the future. Doesn't have to be a rosy future either! Skepticism more than welcome.

I'll compile and add with my own findings and of course all will be posted on the UI for AI blog: <https://lnkd.in/g7dc3-HH>

## LinkedIn Feed Post

What's beyond the future of work?  What's the future of learning?  How will advanced cognition change the bases of capital markets?

We've been developing a framework called **Learning Economies** – a taxonomy of five distinct modes to accelerate learning by leveraging structural facets of LLMs.  More than 'high tides raise all boats', keels and rudders will fundamentally change.

1. **Breadth**: Parallel domain mastery.
2. **Depth**: Accelerated time-to-depth of competence.
3. **Subset**: Rapid vocational retraining/mobility.
4. **Superset**: Field-level reinvention and creative reformation.
5. **Mesh**: Multi-scale knowledge routing and synthesis.

I recently presented this work at GuildCon 2025. If you're thinking about the next 3-5 years of education, HCI, and the future of work, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

## Comment for Dan Saffer's Request

@Dan Saffer, this "Learning Economies" framework might be a useful lens for your AI futures research. It maps how AI accelerates five distinct modes of human capital value (Breadth, Depth, Subset, etc.). I just posted a high-level overview and a presentation link on my feed – would love to get your take on it!
