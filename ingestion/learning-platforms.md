## Resource Summaries

### 1. Math Academy
**URL:** https://mathacademy.com/sign-up-payment

Math Academy is an adaptive learning platform specializing in mathematics education. The platform leverages advanced algorithms to provide personalized learning pathways tailored to each student's current knowledge state and learning pace.

**Key Platform Features (from public information):**
- **Knowledge Graph Architecture**: Curriculum organized as interconnected knowledge nodes with prerequisite relationships
- **Spaced Repetition System**: Algorithmically scheduled review sessions based on forgetting curves
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Real-time adjustment of problem difficulty based on performance
- **Mastery-Based Progression**: Students advance only after demonstrating competency at each level
- **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Coverage from foundational math through advanced topics (calculus, linear algebra, statistics)

## Relevance to Learning Economies

### Personalized Learning Systems

Math Academy exemplifies several core learning-economies principles:

1. **Knowledge State Modeling**
   - Each learner has a unique "knowledge graph state" representing current understanding
   - The system maintains probabilistic estimates of mastery for each concept
   - This maps to learning-economies interest in modeling cognitive capital

2. **Adaptive Pathways**
   - Learning sequences are dynamically generated based on individual progress
   - No fixed curriculum order - paths emerge from prerequisite relationships
   - Demonstrates economic optimization of learning investment

3. **Efficiency Metrics**
   - Platform likely tracks time-to-mastery, retention rates, and concept dependencies
   - These metrics could inform models of learning ROI and cognitive resource allocation

### Knowledge Graph Approaches

The knowledge graph methodology has direct applications:

1. **Prerequisite Networks**
   - Mathematical concepts form directed acyclic graphs of dependencies
   - Understanding which concepts gate others enables optimal sequencing
   - Potential for formal ontological modeling of knowledge domains

2. **Concept Granularity**
   - Decomposition of mathematics into atomic learnable units
   - Balance between granularity (precision) and cognitive load (usability)
   - Informs tensor_vision's ontological fingerprinting approach

3. **Cross-Domain Patterns**
   - Knowledge graph structure may reveal universal patterns in learning
   - Could extend beyond mathematics to other domains
   - Supports holofractal modeling of knowledge structures

### Adaptive Education Principles

1. **Feedback Loop Architecture**
   - Vision (assessment) -> Critic (difficulty adjustment) -> Guardian (mastery verification)
   - Aligns with tensor_vision's vision-critic-guardian modeling pattern

2. **Personalization at Scale**
   - Demonstrates viable business model for individualized learning
   - Relevant to learning-economies study of educational market structures

3. **Retention Economics**
   - Spaced repetition optimizes for long-term retention ROI
   - Quantifies the "depreciation" of cognitive capital over time
   - Economic modeling of memory as an asset class

## Theoretical Integration

### Learning as Economic System

Math Academy provides a concrete case study for modeling:

- **Learning Labor Markets**: How do skills acquire market value?
- **Cognitive Capital Accumulation**: Mathematical skills as durable capital with known depreciation
- **Educational Production Functions**: Inputs (time, problems, feedback) -> Outputs (mastery, retention)

### Platform Economics

- **Subscription Model**: Ongoing relationship rather than one-time transaction
- **Value Proposition**: Time-to-competency vs. traditional methods
- **Network Effects**: Potential for collaborative learning features

## Key Themes for Learning Economies

### Algorithmic Curriculum Design
- Automated sequencing based on knowledge graph analysis
- Real-time optimization of learning pathways
- Scalable personalization through computation

### Measurement and Assessment
- Continuous assessment integrated into learning (not separate tests)
- Probabilistic mastery estimation
- Multi-dimensional competency tracking

### Economic Viability of Personalization
- Demonstrates that personalized learning can scale
- Business model sustainability for adaptive platforms
- Market demand for efficient learning solutions

## Potential Applications

1. **Learning Ontology Development**: Use Math Academy's concept structure as a template for knowledge graph schemas in other domains

2. **Learning ROI Calculator**: Build models predicting learning outcomes based on time/effort investment, calibrated against platform data

3. **Cross-Domain Transfer Study**: Investigate whether knowledge graph patterns from mathematics apply to other learning economies domains

4. **Adaptive System Design**: Extract design principles for applying to other tensor_vision modeling workflows

5. **Market Analysis**: Study competitive landscape of adaptive learning platforms for learning-economies market modeling
