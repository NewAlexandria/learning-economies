## Scope

chinese edcation breadth, and US strategy

- tiktok making wrong programming
- value of learn internal drivers from social motivators
- chinese social media push for showing amazing labor techinuqes that are unique stregnth when china-based but would not translate to the US and would lead a US worker to spend years practicing to do that but it not multiplying the value of the US economy

support depth race to PhD per-student

cost model fo schools charing students
value model of degree programs

track the students and where they go after college

foundational AI labs/companies track progress of students

admins can look at AI as a black box. Magic wands that enables all this
educators need to know how to use the AI tools to support students, at the speed/depth, breadth, subset, superset, network-form

- how to think critically
- how to think across all the breadths

more scientific method and outcome-based strategy for the social sciences
more ethics and behavioral science in the STEM fields

curriculum == measured outcomes

- educator outcomes
- institutional outcomes
- community outcomes

2nd and 3rd order outcomes

design of a beta tool to demo this system of education
relationship to Pete / Pathfinders method

when more text is autocompleted, it should prompt new and different semantics

NIST standards 800-161 refer to the "Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," a publication by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This standard provides comprehensive guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks associated with the supply chain, particularly for federal agencies and organizations handling sensitive information. It outlines best practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that arise from third-party vendors, suppliers, and service providers, ensuring the integrity, security, and resilience of information systems throughout their lifecycle.

For cybersecurity education frameworks, the relevant NIST standard is NIST Special Publication 800-181, known as the "National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework." This framework defines the knowledge, skills, abilities, and tasks required for cybersecurity roles and is widely used to guide curriculum development and workforce training in the field.

## demo scope, additions

Needs to add more context to the "format per hypothesis", to constrain the generation.
what does teacher do it not the expert in anything?

- book is the authority over a teacher
  - journal peer review is the authority over book content
  - educational publishes i the the authority over book organization
- industry board of advisors
