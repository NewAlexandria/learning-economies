# Proposal Summary — CHI 2026 Tools for Thought Workshop

**For submission forms that ask for a short "proposal" or "contribution summary"**

## One paragraph (paste-ready)

We propose the *Learning Economies* framework as a measurement and design basis for tools for thought (TfT) in AI-augmented learning. The framework defines five distinct cognitive economies—Breadth, Depth, Subset, Superset, and Network-form—with operationalizable metrics and data sources, linked theoretically to LLM architectural principles (routing, compression, temperature, addressing, transformation). We introduce a *reflective advisor loop* framed as a cybernetic feedback mechanism: educators act as a board of advisors who interrogate goals, validate patterns, and confirm direction, stabilizing learning trajectories in dense information spaces. The framework applies across learning levels (early education through doctoral and vocational practice) and reframes "gifted" education as multi-economy fluency. We offer concrete design implications by economy and measurable intermediary outcomes (navigation artefacts, reflective checkpoints, resonance traces, scale movements) for TfT evaluation. Our contribution addresses the workshop themes of TfT Outcomes (definition and measurement) and TfT Strategies (design and usage), with a path to operationalisation via testable hypotheses aligned with workforce frameworks such as NICE.

We propose the Learning Economies framework: five cognitive economies (Breadth, Depth, Subset, Superset, Network-form) with operationalizable metrics and a cybernetic reflective advisor loop. The framework applies across learning levels and reframes gifted education as multi-economy fluency. We offer design implications and measurable intermediary outcomes for TfT evaluation and strategy.
