## Abstract (paste-ready)

Generative AI is transforming learning workflows, raising questions about its effects on cognition while also creating opportunities for designing tools for thought (TfT) that protect and augment human thinking. This paper introduces *Learning Economies*, a theoretical framework that provides both a taxonomy for understanding AI-accelerated learning and measurable outcomes for evaluating TfT effectiveness. We identify five fundamental Learning Economies—Breadth, Depth, Subset, Superset, and Network-form—each representing distinct modes of cognitive value creation. Central to this framework is *Resonance*, the transfer mechanism enabling cross-domain knowledge flow. We present operationalizable metrics for each economy, propose a reflective advisor loop—framed as a cybernetic feedback mechanism—where educators serve as navigational guides through dense information spaces, and discuss design implications for GenAI systems. The framework applies across learning levels from early education through vocational and doctoral practice. It offers HCI researchers and practitioners concrete strategies for defining, measuring, and designing cognitive outcomes in AI-augmented learning contexts.

## Short summary (1–2 sentences, for forms with character limits)

Learning Economies is a framework of five cognitive economies (Breadth, Depth, Subset, Superset, Network-form) with operationalizable metrics and a cybernetic reflective advisor loop. It applies across learning levels and offers HCI researchers strategies for defining, measuring, and designing TfT outcomes in AI-augmented learning.
