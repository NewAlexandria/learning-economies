# Miro Board: Problem / Motivation

- GenAI transforms learning workflows but lacks frameworks for measuring cognitive outcomes
- Current TfT evaluation focuses on task performance, missing richer dimensions
- Need for operationalizable metrics that capture intermediary cognitive processes
- Learners need guidance navigating increasingly dense information spaces

# Miro Board: Core Contribution

**The Learning Economies Framework** — Five distinct modes of cognitive value creation

BREADTH — DEPTH — SUBSET — SUPERSET — NETWORK-FORM (linked by RESONANCE)

| Economy     | TfT Outcome                 | Key Metric              |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Breadth     | Parallel domain mastery      | Diversity index          |
| Depth       | Accelerated competence      | Time-to-mastery          |
| Subset      | Cognitive mobility           | Transfer speed           |
| Superset    | Creative synthesis           | Cross-domain connections |
| Network-form| Multi-scale navigation       | Scale traversals         |

# Miro Board: Reflective Advisor Loop

**Educators as "Board of Advisors" — Cybernetic feedback (human-in-the-loop)**

The loop corrects drift and realigns trajectories with goals; applies across learning levels (early education through doctoral/vocational).

- **Goal Interrogation**: Refine learning objectives
- **Pattern Validation**: Check alignment with goals
- **Direction Confirmation**: Validate trajectory

(Flow: Learner Goals → AI Navigation Assistance → Advisor Checkpoint → back to goals)

# Miro Board: Design Strategies for TfT

**By Economy:**

- **Breadth**: Parallel learning threads with AI coherence
- **Depth**: Remove bottlenecks, preserve desirable friction
- **Subset**: Surface transferable patterns (Resonance)
- **Superset**: Enable cross-domain synthesis views
- **Network-form**: Multi-scale navigation interfaces

**Core Principle**: AI should accelerate navigation, not replace it

# Miro Board: Measurable Outcomes

**Primary Metrics:** Diversity index (Breadth), Time-to-competence curves (Depth), Career/domain pivot frequency (Subset), Cross-domain synthesis rate (Superset), Scale traversal efficiency (Network-form)

**Intermediary Artefacts to Track:** Navigation diagrams and notes, Reflective checkpoint documentation, Explicit resonance traces between domains, Scale movement records

# Miro Board: Workshop Theme Alignment

**Primary**: TfT Outcomes: Definition and Measurement — Framework provides concrete, measurable dimensions; metrics capture cognitive richness beyond task performance

**Secondary**: TfT Strategies: Design and Usage — Economy-specific design patterns; Reflective advisor loop as design component

# Miro Board: Discussion Questions

1. How might the five economies map to existing TfT designs you've encountered?
2. What additional metrics would capture cognitive outcomes in your domain?
3. How can the reflective advisor loop be implemented in fully automated TfT systems?
4. Which economy is most neglected in current GenAI learning tools?

# Miro Board: Key Takeaway

**Learning Economies** provides a multi-dimensional framework for TfT evaluation, with a reflective advisor loop framed as a cybernetic feedback mechanism. The framework applies across learning levels (early education through doctoral and vocational practice) and reframes "gifted" education as multi-economy fluency. Success depends on fluid navigation across all five economies, with human advisors as essential stabilizing guides through dense information spaces.
