## Author 1: [Name TBD]

I am a practitioner-researcher working at the intersection of AI systems, education, and workforce development. My work on Learning Economies emerged from observing how AI fundamentally changes not just *what* we can learn, but *how* we navigate knowledge. I am particularly interested in the design of tools that preserve human agency and metacognitive engagement while leveraging AI's pattern-recognition capabilities.

At GuildCon 2025, I presented the Learning Economies framework to educators and technologists. This workshop offers an opportunity to refine the framework through dialogue with HCI researchers focused on cognitive outcomes. I am eager to explore how the reflective advisor loop—positioning educators as navigational guides—can inform TfT design patterns that balance acceleration with cognitive protection.
