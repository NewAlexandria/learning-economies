# Metrics Literature and Sources for Learning Economies

This document provides a **structured list of research literatures and sources** to support an exhaustive search for metrics relevant to the Learning Economies framework (Breadth, Depth, Subset, Superset, Network-form). It does not implement the search—it documents *where* and *how* to search so a follow-up pass can perform it.

**Context**: Metrics are for *evolutionarily advanced* / AI-augmented learning across levels (early education through K–12, vocational, skilled R&D, doctoral) and for *multi-economy fluency* rather than single-axis performance. See [metrics-map-learning-economies.md](./metrics-map-learning-economies.md) for the comprehensive map and suitability rationale.

## 1. Structured List of Literatures

### 1.1 Cognitive Outcomes and Learning Assessment

- **Scope**: Understanding, transfer, metacognition, critical thinking, learning gains.
- **Example sources**: Educational psychology journals (e.g. *Journal of Educational Psychology*, *Educational Psychologist*); learning sciences (e.g. *Journal of the Learning Sciences*, *Cognition and Instruction*); handbooks such as Azevedo & Aleven (2013) *International Handbook of Metacognition and Learning Technologies*; assessment/measurement (e.g. *Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice*, *Applied Measurement in Education*).
- **Relevance to economies**: Depth (retention, time-to-competence); Breadth (multi-domain assessment); intermediary outcomes (metacognitive artefacts).

### 1.2 Tools for Thought and HCI

- **Scope**: TfT evaluation, cognitive augmentation, human–AI interaction, sensemaking tools.
- **Example sources**: CHI proceedings; *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies*; CSCL (e.g. *International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning*); learning-at-scale venues (e.g. LAK, L@S); workshops on tools for thought, cognitive augmentation, and generative AI in learning.
- **Relevance**: Directly aligned with TfT workshop goals; design implications; intermediary artefacts (navigation, reflection).

### 1.3 Transfer of Learning and Cross-Domain

- **Scope**: Near/far transfer, analogical reasoning, structural similarity, knowledge application across contexts.
- **Example sources**: Cognitive science (e.g. *Cognitive Science*, *Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition*); educational psychology (transfer of learning); structural alignment and analogy (e.g. Gentner, Holyoak).
- **Relevance**: Subset (career pivot, retraining); Resonance; Superset (cross-domain synthesis).

### 1.4 Depth and Expertise

- **Scope**: Deliberate practice, time-to-competence, expertise development, mastery curves.
- **Example sources**: Ericsson-style expertise literature; *Psychological Review*; domain expertise (e.g. *Applied Cognitive Psychology*); accelerated learning and compression of training (military, medical, professional).
- **Relevance**: Depth economy; time-to-90th-percentile; retention after acceleration.

### 1.5 Breadth and Interdisciplinary

- **Scope**: Portfolio learning, interdisciplinary competence, diversity indices, multi-domain mastery.
- **Example sources**: Higher education journals; interdisciplinary studies; diversity/entropy indices in education; double/multiple major and credential portfolios.
- **Relevance**: Breadth economy; parallel pipelines; diversity index of fields.

### 1.6 Vocational and Workforce

- **Scope**: Competency frameworks, retraining, employability, workforce development, skills mobility.
- **Example sources**: NICE (NIST 800-181) and aligned workforce frameworks; O*NET; workforce development and adult education journals; vocational education research; employability and time-to-employment metrics.
- **Relevance**: Subset (pivot, retraining); NIST-800-181 testable hypotheses; competency-based measures.

### 1.7 Gifted and Advanced Learning

- **Scope**: Identification, acceleration, multi-dimensional talent, beyond single-axis metrics.
- **Example sources**: Gifted education journals (e.g. *Gifted Child Quarterly*, *Roeper Review*); talent development; acceleration and enrichment; multi-dimensional assessment of advanced learners.
- **Relevance**: Reframing “gifted” as multi-economy fluency; applicability across levels; avoidance of single-axis scores.

### 1.8 AI in Education and Learning Technologies

- **Scope**: AIEd, learning analytics, adaptive systems, intelligent tutoring, GenAI in education.
- **Example sources**: *International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education* (IJAIED); LAK (Learning Analytics & Knowledge); EDM (Educational Data Mining); systematic reviews (e.g. MDPI *Education Sciences*, AI in education reviews); AI tutoring and scaffolding.
- **Relevance**: AI-accelerated learning; scaffolding/amplification/compression; level/modality (early to doctoral).

### 1.9 Cybernetics and Feedback in Learning

- **Scope**: Self-regulation, feedback loops, second-order cybernetics in education/HCI.
- **Example sources**: Self-regulated learning (e.g. Azevedo, Zimmerman); feedback in learning (Hattie, Nicol); cybernetic and control-theoretic views of learning systems (where applicable in education/HCI).
- **Relevance**: Reflective advisor loop; human-in-the-loop; goal interrogation and direction confirmation.

## 2. Search Strategy Notes

### 2.1 Suggested Search Terms

- **By economy**: “breadth” OR “multi-domain” OR “interdisciplinary” + learning outcomes; “depth” OR “expertise” OR “time-to-competence” + learning; “transfer” OR “retraining” OR “career pivot” + skills; “cross-domain synthesis” OR “field reinvention” OR “creative destruction” + education; “multi-scale” OR “knowledge graph” OR “scale traversal” + learning.
- **By mechanism**: “resonance” (if used in literature); “metacognition” + learning technologies; “scaffolding” + learning outcomes; “deliberate practice” + acceleration.
- **By context**: “AI in education” OR “learning analytics” OR “intelligent tutoring”; “tools for thought” OR “cognitive augmentation”; “workforce” OR “competency framework” OR “NICE”.

### 2.2 Key Authors and Traditions (Examples)

- **Metacognition / SRL**: Azevedo, Aleven, Zimmerman.
- **Transfer**: Barnett, Ceci; Gentner, Holyoak (analogy/structure).
- **Expertise**: Ericsson; domain-specific expertise literature.
- **TfT / augmentation**: Engelbart; Kay; contemporary TfT and GenAI workshop literature.
- **Assessment**: Messick; Kane; validity and use of assessments in learning.

### 2.3 Connection to Five Economies and Modalities

- **Breadth**: Search for multi-domain, portfolio, diversity, interdisciplinary metrics.
- **Depth**: Search for time-to-competence, retention, acceleration, deliberate practice.
- **Subset**: Search for transfer, retraining, employability, pivot, mobility.
- **Superset**: Search for synthesis, reinvention, obviation, disruptive innovation in fields.
- **Network-form**: Search for multi-scale, knowledge graphs, path length, topology.
- **Evolutionarily advanced / level**: Include terms for early ed, K–12, vocational, doctoral where relevant; avoid PhD-only or single-level metrics.
