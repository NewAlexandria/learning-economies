# Learning Economy 3: subsets and microcredentials

## ASU Microcredential Model: A Real-World Example of the Subset Learning Economy

The Arizona State University (ASU) microcredential model represents a practical implementation of the **Subset Learning Economy** - the third economy in our framework focused on vocational mobility through rapid retraining. This model demonstrates how educational institutions can support career pivots and skill transitions in compressed timeframes.

### Connection to Learning Economies Framework

**ASU's model directly implements Subset Economy principles:**

- **Vocational Mobility:** Enables rapid career transitions through modular learning
- **Retraining Efficiency:** Compresses traditional retraining timelines from years to months
- **Resonance Application:** Leverages transferable skills and competencies across domains
- **Stackable Progression:** Allows incremental skill building that supports lifelong learning

## How the ASU Microcredential Model Works

### Core Components

**Modular / Short-form Learning Units**

- **Micro-learning units (MLUs) or "micro-badges":** Short courses (~10 hours instruction + 5-10 hours study)
- Focus on specific skills/competencies, not broad degree-level curriculum
- Digital badge or "micro-badge" awarded upon successful completion and assessment

**Stackability**

- **Stackable design:** Multiple micro-badges within a topic area combine into full "badge" (microcredential)
- Indicates deeper proficiency through accumulation
- Supports flexible, modular progression
- Can count toward larger credentials (graduate degrees) through ASU's "stackable credentials" model

**Levels of Complexity**

- **Leveling system (Levels 1-4)** for micro-badges
- **Level 1:** Hands-on introduction for learners with no prior experience
- **Level 2:** Apply skills in real-world contexts
- **Level 3:** Skill refinement
- **Level 4:** Advanced industry application & troubleshooting

**Flexibility, Accessibility, Affordability**

- Designed for adult, non-traditional, working learners
- Flexible modality (online, hybrid)
- More affordable than full degrees
- Agile response to evolving industry needs
- Rapid development of new credentials aligned with workforce demands

**Recognition & Industry Alignment**

- Credentials align with current industry and employer skill needs
- Skill-based assessments (projects, real-world scenarios)
- Digital badges signal demonstrated targeted competency to employers

**Pathways to Larger Credentials**

- Valuable as stand-alone credentials
- Provide pathways to Graduate Certificates or Master's degrees
- Learners can "stack up" into larger credentials when ready

## Why This Model Serves Subset Economy Goals

**Low Barrier to Entry**

- Each unit is short and focused
- Minimal time investment lets learners "test the waters"
- Reduces risk of career transition attempts

**Flexible Schedule & Modality**

- Ideal for working professionals and career switchers
- Supports upskilling for specific needs
- Accommodates non-traditional learning schedules

**Targeted Specific Skills**

- Learners gain targeted skills quickly
- No need to enroll in full degree programs
- Direct alignment with market demands

**Stackable and Incremental**

- Gradual skill building fits lifelong learning mindset
- Supports continuous career adaptation
- Enables portfolio approach to skill development

**Industry-Relevant and Responsive**

- Credentials reflect current workforce needs
- Keeps learning relevant to market conditions
- Enables rapid response to industry changes

**Recognition via Digital Badges**

- Skills visible on resumes, LinkedIn, professional platforms
- Aids career mobility and transition
- Provides portable credentialing

## Example Implementation Details

**ASU Fulton Schools of Engineering:**

- Micro-badge: ~10 hours instruction + ~5-10 hours additional study
- Full microcredential: Complete four approved micro-badges (~40-80 hours total)
- Guiding principles: Flexible, Accessible, Scalable, Stackable, Affordable, Agile
- Thousands of digital credentials issued through Learning Enterprise and Global Outreach & Extended Education (GOEE)

## Alignment with Subset Economy Metrics

**ASU Model Addresses Key Subset Metrics:**

1. **Number of distinct professional fields mastered:** Stackable design enables multiple domain competency
2. **Average retraining time to employability:** Compressed from years to months through modular approach
3. **Frequency and speed of successful career pivots:** Low-barrier entry supports frequent transitions
4. **Diversity index of career paths traversed:** Cross-domain microcredentials enable diverse career trajectories
5. **Retention rate of core skills after transitioning:** Stackable design preserves and builds upon prior competencies
6. **Adaptability score:** Rapid credential development responds to market shifts
7. **Time to first independent contribution:** Focused skill development accelerates workplace contribution

## Considerations for Subset Economy Implementation

**When evaluating microcredential models:**

- **Employer Recognition:** Ensure micro-badges are accepted in target fields
- **Learning Depth vs. Full Degree:** Ideal for upskilling; major career changes may still require full degrees
- **Stackability and Transferability:** Verify how credentials apply to larger programs
- **Time/Cost Trade-offs:** Ensure investment provides desired value (skills, recognition)
- **Quality and Assessment:** Strong microcredentials emphasize real-world application
- **Modality & Scheduling:** Ensure delivery mode fits learner needs
- **Career Relevance:** Pursue credentials aligned with professional goals
- **Credential Portability:** Check how credits transfer or stack for future degrees

## Implications for Learning Economy Implementation

**ASU's model demonstrates:**

1. **Institutional Adaptation:** Universities can restructure to support Subset economy principles
2. **Industry Partnership:** Direct alignment with workforce needs accelerates career transitions
3. **Technology Integration:** Digital badges and online delivery support rapid scaling
4. **Assessment Innovation:** Skill-based, project-focused evaluation aligns with competency-based learning
5. **Pathway Design:** Clear progression routes from microcredentials to larger credentials

**Key Success Factors:**

- Modular, stackable design
- Industry-aligned content
- Flexible delivery methods
- Clear progression pathways
- Digital credentialing systems
- Continuous market responsiveness

## Conclusion

The ASU microcredential model provides a concrete example of how educational institutions can implement Subset Learning Economy principles. By focusing on modular, stackable, industry-aligned credentials, ASU has created a system that supports rapid career transitions and lifelong learning adaptation.

This model demonstrates that the Subset economy is not just theoretical but already being implemented in practice, providing a roadmap for other institutions seeking to support vocational mobility in an AI-accelerated learning environment.
