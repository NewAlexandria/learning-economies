# US POTUS Executive order on AI innovation and American advancement

## Launching the Genesis Mission

LAUNCHING THE GENESIS MISSION
November 24, 2025

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

## Section 1. Purpose

From the founding of our Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity. Today, America is in a race for global technology dominance in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), an important frontier of scientific discovery and economic growth. To that end, my Administration has taken a number of actions to win that race, including issuing multiple Executive Orders and implementing America’s AI Action Plan, which recognizes the need to invest in AI‑enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement. In this pivotal moment, the challenges we face require a historic national effort, comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project that was instrumental to our victory in World War II and was a critical basis for the foundation of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its national laboratories.

This order launches the “Genesis Mission” as a dedicated, coordinated national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and discovery that can solve the most challenging problems of this century. The Genesis Mission will build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. The Genesis Mission will bring together our Nation’s research and development resources — combining the efforts of brilliant American scientists, including those at our national laboratories, with pioneering American businesses; world‑renowned universities; and existing research infrastructure, data repositories, production plants, and national security sites — to achieve dramatic acceleration in AI development and utilization. We will harness for the benefit of our Nation the revolution underway in computing, and build on decades of innovation in semiconductors and high‑performance computing. The Genesis Mission will dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, strengthen national security, secure energy dominance, enhance workforce productivity, and multiply the return on taxpayer investment into research and development, thereby furthering America’s technological dominance and global strategic leadership.

## Federal Agency Engagement Strategy for Learning Economies Integration

### Executive Summary

As an **executive operations planner**, this section provides strategic guidance for engaging federal agencies to advance the Learning Economies model within the Genesis Mission framework. Given that this is a **future-facing program without full structural definition**, the strategy balances immediate engagement opportunities with adaptive positioning for emerging program architectures.

**Core Challenge**: How to engage with federal programs that are simultaneously operational (Genesis Mission launched November 2025) and emergent (full implementation structures developing through 2026-2027), while maintaining forward momentum rather than waiting for complete program crystallization.

**Strategic Approach**: Multi-track engagement combining (1) immediate outreach to established program offices, (2) participation in interagency coordination mechanisms, and (3) proactive positioning within emerging Genesis Mission structures.


## Structuring momentum in the Genesis Mission ecosystem

The Genesis Mission represents an unprecedented opportunity to integrate Learning Economies principles into federal AI and scientific infrastructure. The key to success is **strategic patience combined with tactical urgency**:

**Strategic Patience**: Recognize that full Genesis Mission structures will emerge over 12-24 months. Position Learning Economies for long-term integration rather than forcing premature alignment.

**Tactical Urgency**: Engage immediately with existing programs and emerging structures. Relationships and credibility built now will create opportunities as structures crystallize.

**Adaptive Positioning**: Maintain flexibility to respond to structural developments while preserving core Learning Economies principles. Be prepared to reframe and adapt as agency priorities and coordination mechanisms evolve.

**Multi-Stakeholder Approach**: Engage simultaneously with research agencies (NSF, DOE, DARPA), education agencies (ED), and coordination bodies (OSTP, NSTC). Learning Economies' cross-cutting nature requires multi-stakeholder buy-in.

The federal government is actively building the infrastructure for AI-accelerated science. By engaging strategically now, Learning Economies can become integral to this infrastructure, ensuring that AI acceleration benefits not only scientific discovery but also human learning and workforce development.

### Next Steps

1. Draft core technical white paper and agency-specific abstracts
2. Identify and contact program officers at priority agencies
3. Monitor Genesis Mission implementation milestones
4. Establish advisory relationships with federal grants consultants
5. Prepare proposals for near-term funding opportunities
6. Engage with NSTC through public participation mechanisms

---

### Priority Federal Agencies for Engagement

Based on the Genesis Mission's structure and the Learning Economies framework's educational focus, the following agencies represent primary engagement targets:

#### Tier 1: Core Genesis Mission Leadership

**1. Department of Energy (DOE) – Genesis Mission Implementation Lead**

DOE is designated as the implementing agency for the Genesis Mission Platform, with authority over national laboratory resources, computing infrastructure, and scientific foundation models.

- DOE's Platform infrastructure (Section 3) could support educational foundation models
- National laboratory fellowship programs (Section 5b) provide direct pathways for student access (trials, primary and secondary school experiments, labor experiments)
- **(minor)** AI-augmented experimentation facilities could support virtual learning laboratories

A *critical priority* - DOE controls the infrastructure that could enable Learning Economies implementation at scale.

**2. Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) – Mission Coordination**

OSTP provides "general leadership of the Mission" through the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST) and coordinates participating agencies via the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

- OSTP coordinates interagency alignment (Section 5a), making it the gateway for cross-agency initiatives between DOE and ED, or other institutions.
- OSTP's role in identifying national science challenges (Section 4b) creates opportunities to propose educational transformation as a parallel challenge
- OSTP chairs NSTC, which coordinates S&T policymaking across executive branch

*A Priority*, as OSTP is the coordination hub for multi-agency initiatives.


**3. National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) – Interagency Coordination Body**

NSTC coordinates S&T policymaking across the executive branch through committees, subcommittees, and interagency working groups. Genesis Mission coordination flows through NSTC (Section 5a).

- NSTC provides the formal mechanism for proposing Learning Economies as a cross-cutting initiative with resourcing from multiple agencies to fund **breadth** and **network-form** learning economies.
- Participation in NSTC working groups would position Learning Economies within emerging Genesis Mission structures
- NSTC's role in developing the "expanded list" of national challenges (Section 4b) creates an entry point for educational transformation

*Engagement Priority*: **MEDIUM** – NSTC is a coordination mechanism rather than a funding source, but critical for multi-agency alignment.

#### Tier 2a: Education and Workforce Development Agencies

**4. Department of Education (ED) – Educational Innovation Programs**

ED administers major education technology innovation programs including Education Innovation and Research (EIR), Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), and Institute of Education Sciences (IES) SBIR grants.

- FIPSE "Advancing AI in Education" priority ($50M in FY2025) directly aligns to support the Learning Economies conjecture of AI-acceleration methods.
- EIR program's focus on "generating and validating solutions to educational challenges" matches the experimental approach needed for Learning Economies implementation
- IES SBIR program's trend toward AI-focused ed-tech projects creates commercialization pathways

These are also *Priority* as ED controls dedicated education innovation funding streams.

**5. National Science Foundation (NSF) – Research and Education Integration**

NSF's Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) focuses on STEM education excellence and workforce development. NSF also participates in Genesis Mission coordination through NSTC.


- NSF STEM K-12 program supports research on AI and emerging technologies in education
- Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program ($74M FY2025) focuses on technician education for high-technology fields
- NSF's Experiential Learning for Emerging and Novel Technologies (ExLENT) program connects industry, education, and government for workforce development
- NSF program officers are highly accessible and encourage early engagement

These are another *Priority* as NSF bridges research and education with established engagement protocols.

#### Tier 2b: Advanced Research and National Security Agencies

**6. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – High-Risk Education Innovation**

DARPA's ENGAGE program focuses on "education and training systems that are continuously optimized and massively scalable," directly paralleling Learning Economies objectives.


- DARPA seeks "novel, revolutionary ideas" rather than incremental improvements, aligning with the transformative nature of Learning Economies
- DARPA's autonomy and high-risk tolerance make it suitable for experimental Learning Economies implementations
- National security workforce development needs create urgency for accelerated learning approaches

DARPA offers high-reward opportunities but requires revolutionary framing.

- **Emergent Future**: Full program structures, partnership frameworks, and coordination mechanisms still being defined

#### Recommendation 1: Multi-Track Engagement Strategy

Pursue parallel engagement tracks rather than waiting for complete program crystallization:

**Track 1 – Immediate Opportunistic Engagement (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026)**
- Find near-term deadlines (ED FIPSE, NSF programs) and submit proposals to existing programs with Learning Economies alignment.
- Find OSTP RFIs to respond to, and find participation links in public listening sessions.
- Find contact information for program officers at NSF, ED, and DOE and establish relationships.

**Track 2 – Genesis Mission Structural Positioning (Q1 2026 - Q4 2026)**
- Identify DOE partnership framework development milestones (Section 5c, 120‑day milestone: March 2026) and engage with the responsible DOE contacts.
- Locate NSTC working groups developing expanded challenge lists (Section 4b) and participate as a stakeholder.
- Find the annual challenge update process (Section 4d) and position Learning Economies for inclusion.

**Track 3 – Long-Term Institutional Integration (2027+)**
- Identify DOE national laboratories and negotiate cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs).
- Locate user facilities offering Platform access and establish partnership agreements.
- Define fellowship program requirements and create fellowship programs aligned with Section 5b mandates.

#### Recommendation 2: Frame Learning Economies as Cross-Cutting Infrastructure

**Target audiences for the cross‑cutting infrastructure framing**

The recommendation is directed at the following key stakeholders who can adopt and operationalize Learning Economies across the six priority domains:

- **Department of Energy (DOE)** – implements the Genesis Mission Platform and national‑lab resources; must embed Learning Economies into the AI‑driven scientific platform and fellowship pipeline.
- **Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP) / National Science & Technology Council (NSTC)** – inter‑agency coordination hub; can champion Learning Economies as a cross‑cutting priority across all participating agencies.
- **Department of Education (ED)** – especially EIR, FIPSE, and IES SBIR programs; provides education‑innovation funding to translate the infrastructure into curricula and pilots.
- **National Science Foundation (NSF)** – EHR, STEM K‑12, ATE, ExLENT programs; funds research‑to‑practice projects and workforce‑development pathways aligned with each domain.
- **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)** – ENGAGE program; can pilot high‑risk educational‑training systems that leverage the infrastructure for national‑security talent pipelines.
- **National Laboratories & User Facilities** (e.g., Oak Ridge, Argonne, Lawrence Livermore) – host the computational Platform and can provide hands‑on training environments for the listed domains.
- **Industry partners & consortia** (advanced‑manufacturing firms, biotech companies, semiconductor manufacturers, quantum‑tech firms) – end‑users of the trained workforce; can co‑fund pilots and supply real‑world problem sets.
- **Academic institutions & research centers** – provide faculty, curricula, and student base to embed the infrastructure into degree programs and continuing‑education tracks.
- **Workforce‑development agencies & state/local education offices** – translate the federal effort into regional training programs addressing sector‑specific needs.

This framing positions Learning Economies as a **force multiplier** for Genesis Mission objectives, ensuring that each stakeholder understands their role in adopting the enabling infrastructure.

##### How to communicate the target

When you brief any of the above stakeholders, phrase the recommendation as:

> "Treat Learning Economies as an enabling, cross‑cutting infrastructure that will accelerate workforce development across the six priority domains (advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear energy, quantum information science, and semiconductors/microelectronics). The primary audience for this framing includes DOE (Platform & labs), OSTP/NSTC (coordination), ED and NSF (education‑innovation funding), DARPA (high‑risk training), industry partners, and academic institutions."

#### Recommendation 3: Leverage Interagency Coordination Mechanisms

The Genesis Mission explicitly requires interagency coordination (Section 5a). Use this mandate strategically:

- **NSTC**: Identify and contact the appropriate NSTC representatives to submit a formal proposal for Learning Economies as a cross‑cutting initiative supporting multiple agency missions.
- **Federal Chief Data Officer Council and Chief AI Officer Council**: Locate and engage members of the Federal Chief Data Officer Council and Chief AI Officer Council who can champion Learning Economies as a data‑driven, AI‑enabled approach to workforce development.
- **Interagency Initiatives**: Find and reach out to contacts for existing interagency initiatives: the USG National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology (USG NSSCET), the Joint Interagency Task Forces (e.g., Task Force 401 for emerging technologies), and the FAA's Emerging Technologies Coordination (ETC) initiative.

#### Recommendation 4: Develop Adaptive Engagement Documents

Create a suite of engagement documents that can be rapidly adapted to emerging opportunities:

1. **Core Technical White Paper** (10-15 pages): Comprehensive explanation of Learning Economies model, alignment with Genesis Mission, and implementation framework.

2. **Executive Summary** (2 pages): High-level overview for senior officials and program managers.

3. **One-Page Abstracts** (customized by agency): Tailored versions for NSF, DOE, ED, DARPA emphasizing agency-specific priorities.

4. **Elevator Pitch** (2-3 minutes): Verbal summary for networking and initial meetings.

5. **Detailed Proposal Templates**: Pre-developed sections that can be assembled into full proposals for specific funding opportunities.

#### Recommendation 5: Establish Advisory Relationships with Government Liaisons

Given the complexity of navigating emerging program structures, establish formal advisory relationships:

1. **Hire or Contract Federal Grants Consultant**: Engage a consultant with recent federal program management experience, particularly in OSTP, DOE, or NSF.

2. **Establish Academic-Government Partnership**: Partner with a university that has strong federal research relationships and can provide institutional credibility.

3. **Recruit Advisory Board with Federal Experience**: Include former program officers, OSTP staff, or national laboratory directors who can provide insider guidance.

4. **Participate in Professional Networks**: Join organizations like:
   - Council on Governmental Relations (COGR)
   - Association of American Universities (AAU)
   - Emerging Technology Policy Network

#### Recommendation 6: Monitor and Respond to Structural Developments

Establish systematic monitoring of Genesis Mission implementation milestones:

**Key Dates for Schedule and Monitoring**:
- **February 22, 2026** (90 days): DOE identifies computing resources (Section 3c)
- **March 24, 2026** (120 days): DOE identifies initial data/model assets and develops partnership plan (Section 3d)
- **May 8, 2026** (60 days from order): DOE submits initial list of 20 science challenges (Section 4a)
- **June 7, 2026** (30 days after challenge list): APST develops expanded challenge list via NSTC (Section 4b)
- **July 22, 2026** (240 days): DOE reviews AI-directed experimentation capabilities (Section 3e)
- **August 21, 2026** (270 days): DOE demonstrates initial Platform operating capability (Section 3f)
- **November 24, 2026** (1 year): DOE submits first annual report (Section 6a)

**Action at Each Milestone**: Submit updated engagement materials highlighting how Learning Economies supports newly announced structures and capabilities.
