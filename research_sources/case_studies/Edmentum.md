## Challenge

When Dr. Brandon Robinson, superintendent and cyber supervisor at Jefferson-Morgan School District (JM) in the rural Greene County, Pennsylvania, considered a cyber learning program, it wasn’t out of admiration for online education—it was out of frustration. As a high school principal at the time, Dr. Robinson saw his district losing students to statewide cyber charter schools.
“Like many schools, we were watching kids leave for big-name cyber charters, and it was costing us up to $24,000 per student,” said Dr. Robinson. “We had to do something.”
For Dr. Robinson, the solution wasn’t just about retaining students; it was about reimagining what was possible in a small district. Dr. Robinson knew that he needed to stop the financial drain by building a district-run cyber academy, but he also knew it would be critical to give students access to courses that the small school community couldn’t traditionally offer.
With these goals in mind, JM began a partnership in 2019 with Edmentum’s EdOptions Academy to provide scalable, flexible, high-quality instruction and support across multiple formats to sustainably meet the needs of its diverse student body.

## Solution

Jefferson-Morgan’s JM eLearning Academy Cyber Program has grown into a fully integrated, district-run virtual academy powered by Edmentum, and it serves a wide range of learners, including homebound elementary students and high-performing high school athletes needing flexibility.
With Edmentum’s EdOptions Academy, Dr. Robinson discovered a platform that effectively supports the diverse needs of all students. The program offers flexible learning options, including live, asynchronous, and blended formats, allowing students to engage in ways that work best for them. It also features built-in tutoring and real-time support to ensure that learners receive timely help.

> “The flexibility is unmatched,” Dr. Robinson shared. “Some students want to work asynchronously and just pop in for tutoring. Others need a teacher in front of them every day. Edmentum allows us to serve both—without compromise. There’s not any situation we can’t handle through our brick-and-mortar and our partnership with Edmentum.”

Edmentum provides turnkey tools for parents and staff, such as onboarding videos and user guides, making the platform easy to navigate. Dedicated representatives and consistent communication further enhance the overall experience, creating a strong support system for the entire school community.

When parents consider other outside cyber options, Dr. Robinson shows them that the JM eLearning Academy offers flexible learning paths and keeps students connected to the school community. Students split their day between in-person and online classes, attend school events, participate in athletics, and receive in-person support while learning in a way that works best for them. And when challenges arise, like sudden staffing gaps due to the nationwide teacher shortage, Edmentum has provided a reliable stopgap.

What truly sets this partnership apart is Edmentum’s commitment to communication and parent engagement. With broad features such as branded resources and ongoing progress tracking, Dr. Robinson has seen firsthand how well-informed parents drive student success.

> “Before, I was the one making login tutorials and onboarding materials,” he recalled. “Now, I send families the Edmentum portal—everything is already there. It saves us time and builds trust.”

## Result

At JM eLearning Academy, implementing Edmentum led to several important outcomes, including increased student retention by enabling schools to expand course offerings and respond more effectively to teacher shortages. Communication between staff and families was also strengthened and streamlined within the program. With just a few clicks, Dr. Robinson can provide complete visibility into student performance for all necessary stakeholders.

> “This is not just about plugging students into an online program,” Dr. Robinson emphasized. “It’s about offering high-quality, flexible learning while keeping families connected to our district.”

After struggling with student loss to outside cyber charters, course-offering limitations, and staffing shortages, Jefferson-Morgan School District has built a thriving, future-ready program with Edmentum.

> “This is our only cyber partnership—because it works,” Dr. Robinson said. “If I didn’t have it, I’d have to piece together seven different solutions. With Edmentum, we can do it all.”
