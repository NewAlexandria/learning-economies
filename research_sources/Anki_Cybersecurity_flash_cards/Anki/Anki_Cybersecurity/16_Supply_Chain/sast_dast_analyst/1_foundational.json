      "distractor_analysis": "Low-Frequency (LF) RFID is used for car key fobs and some access control, but the specific mention of contactless payment and transit cards points away from LF. Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) RFID is primarily used for longer-range applications like warehouse inventory and toll systems, not typical short-range access control or payment. Extremely High-Frequency (EHF) is not a standard RFID frequency range for these applications.",
      "analogy": "Think of RFID frequencies like different lanes on a highway: LF is for slow, short-distance local traffic (animal tracking, basic access); HF is for medium-speed, common city travel (payments, transit, office badges); and UHF is for high-speed, long-distance freight (inventory, logistics)."
