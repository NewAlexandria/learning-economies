Noise from other electronic devices, interference from other RF sources (like microwave ovens), and multipath fading (where signals arrive at the receiver via multiple paths, causing destructive interference) can all lead to frames being lost or corrupted during transmission. Positive acknowledgments ensure that if a frame is sent, the sender knows whether it was successfully received, allowing for retransmission if necessary. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining data integrity over an unreliable medium. Defense: Implement robust error detection and correction codes, use adaptive modulation and coding schemes, and employ spatial diversity techniques (e.g., MIMO) to improve signal reliability.",

Clients download a manifest file to learn about these versions. Based on their current available bandwidth and buffer status, clients dynamically request small chunks (segments) of the video from the most suitable quality version using standard HTTP GET requests. This allows for seamless adaptation to fluctuating network conditions, providing the best possible viewing experience without interruption. From a security perspective, an attacker might try to manipulate the reported bandwidth or buffer status to force a client to download lower quality streams, or to cause buffering issues by interfering with chunk requests. Defenses include robust client-side validation of network conditions and server-side monitoring of client requests for anomalies.",

Pre-buffering the entire video at the highest quality would defeat the purpose of adaptive streaming and be impractical for long videos. While compression is part of video encoding, DASH&#39;s core innovation is offering multiple quality levels, not just better compression for a single stream.",

Defense: While UDP is often chosen for performance, it can be exploited for denial-of-service attacks (e.g., UDP amplification).

This conversion is necessary because the core of the telephone network, particularly the long-haul trunks, operates with digital information (bits), not analog voice. The codec samples the analog signal 8000 times per second and quantizes each sample into an 8-bit number, resulting in a 64 kbps digital stream per voice channel. This allows the analog voice to be transported efficiently over digital trunks using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).

This reduces maintenance overhead and increases adaptability. For example, a CPU scheduling mechanism can be designed to support various scheduling policies (e.g., prioritize I/O-bound tasks or CPU-bound tasks) without altering the scheduler&#39;s core logic. Defense: In a security context, this principle allows security policies (e.g., &#39;only administrators can install software&#39;) to be enforced by flexible mechanisms (e.g., access control lists, privilege checks) that can be reconfigured without changing the operating system&#39;s fundamental security primitives.",

ARP dynamically resolves an IP address to its corresponding hardware address, allowing the operating system&#39;s network driver to correctly address frames for transmission on the local network. Without ARP, an IP packet could not be encapsulated into a link-layer frame for delivery to a specific host on the same segment.
