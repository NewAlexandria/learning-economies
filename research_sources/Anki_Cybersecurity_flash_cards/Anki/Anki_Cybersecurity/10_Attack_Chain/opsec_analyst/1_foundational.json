These links are susceptible to noise, interference (e.g., microwave ovens), and multipath fading. To compensate for this unreliability, 802.11 incorporates positive acknowledgments for every transmitted frame. If an acknowledgment is not received, the frame is considered lost and must be retransmitted. This &#39;all or nothing&#39; atomic operation ensures data delivery despite link instability.",

Prioritizing high-speed data rates over signal quality will lead to more frame loss and retransmissions, ultimately decreasing effective throughput and increasing network activity.
