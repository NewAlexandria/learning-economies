      "core_logic": "The WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) standard was designed to provide security comparable to wired networks. However, it suffered from fundamental cryptographic weaknesses, primarily due to its use of a static, short initialization vector (IV) and a weak key management system. These flaws made WEP traffic relatively easy to decrypt, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on communications and gain unauthorized network access. This led to the development of more robust security standards like 802.1X for authentication and 802.11i (WPA2) for stronger encryption and key management.",
