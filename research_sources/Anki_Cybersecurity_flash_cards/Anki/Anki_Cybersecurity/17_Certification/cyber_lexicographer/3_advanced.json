The goal is to either stop these events from being generated entirely or to filter them so that malicious activities are not reported to the EDR.",

The second describes code injection for access, a different phase or goal than evading event tracing. The third describes techniques for hiding activity by blending in, rather than directly disabling the monitoring mechanism itself.",
