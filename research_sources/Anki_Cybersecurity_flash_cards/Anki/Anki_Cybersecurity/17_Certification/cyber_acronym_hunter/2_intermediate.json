      "core_logic": "CEH stands for Certified Ethical Hacker, a professional certification offered by EC-Council. It validates an individual&#39;s skills in ethical hacking techniques and methodologies, focusing on penetration testing and vulnerability assessment with legal and ethical boundaries.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The distractors test precise recall of the certification&#39;s name. &#39;Enterprise&#39; is a plausible but incorrect substitute for &#39;Ethical&#39;. &#39;Expert Hacking&#39; changes the grammatical structure and specific terminology. &#39;Cybersecurity Ethical Hacking&#39; incorrectly expands the &#39;C&#39; to a broader domain rather than the specific &#39;Certified&#39; status.",
      "analogy": "Think of CEH like a &#39;Certified Public Accountant&#39; (CPA) for hacking. It&#39;s a formal recognition that you&#39;re qualified to perform a specific, complex task (auditing finances or hacking systems) according to established rules and ethics."
