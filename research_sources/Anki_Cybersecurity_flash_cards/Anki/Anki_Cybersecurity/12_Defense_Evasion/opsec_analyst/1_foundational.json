      "core_logic": "Attacking network devices, even during a penetration test, carries a significant risk of causing network crashes or Denial of Service (DoS) conditions. To prevent these unintended and potentially catastrophic impacts on a client&#39;s live operations, it is crucial to conduct all initial and potentially disruptive tests within a controlled, isolated test network. This allows operators to refine their techniques and understand the impact of their tools without affecting critical production systems.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Using commercial-grade equipment is good for realism but doesn&#39;t mitigate the risk of testing directly on production. Implementing Snort in production is for detection, not for preventing the initial impact of a test. Focusing on firewall evasion directly on a target network without prior testing in a lab environment is a high-risk activity that could lead to service disruption.",

      "core_logic": "The &#39;right to erasure,&#39; also known as the &#39;right to be forgotten,&#39; is a fundamental data subject right under regulations like GDPR. It allows individuals to request that organizations delete their personal data under certain conditions, thereby directly enabling them to reduce their digital footprint.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. The right to rectification allows individuals to have inaccurate personal data corrected. The right to restrict processing allows individuals to limit the way an organization uses their data, but not necessarily delete it.
