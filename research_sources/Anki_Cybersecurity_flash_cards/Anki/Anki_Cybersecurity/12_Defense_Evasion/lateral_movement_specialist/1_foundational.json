Flaws in these systems can lead to direct bypasses of security controls, allowing malicious traffic to pass undetected or even be actively exploited. Attackers frequently target subtle differences in how these products interpret packets versus how end hosts do, seeking evasion techniques.",
      "distractor_analysis": "While TCP/IP stacks on end hosts are fundamental, their vulnerabilities often lead to host compromise rather than network-wide security bypasses. Routing/NAT/load-balancing products are critical for network function and can have security implications, but their direct role isn&#39;t *primarily* security enforcement. Network-monitoring products are generally passive and interpret traffic, making them less of a direct security vulnerability target for network traversal than active security enforcement points.",
      "analogy": "If a network is a fortress, security products are the guards at the gate. A flaw in a guard&#39;s training or equipment is a direct threat to the fortress&#39;s integrity, whereas a flaw in the road leading to the gate (routing) or a worker&#39;s tools inside (end-host stack) might be serious but not as immediately critical to the gate&#39;s function."
