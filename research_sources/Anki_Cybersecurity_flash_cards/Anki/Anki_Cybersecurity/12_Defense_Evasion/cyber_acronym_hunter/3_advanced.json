    ],
    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "A Deferred Procedure Call (DPC) is a mechanism in the Windows operating system kernel that allows high-priority tasks (like interrupt service routines) to schedule lower-priority tasks to be executed later, at a lower interrupt request level (IRQL). This prevents high-priority tasks from being blocked and ensures system responsiveness. In memory forensics, DPC routines can be analyzed to detect malicious activity, as malware might register its own DPCs to execute code covertly.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The distractors are designed to sound plausible by using terms commonly associated with operating systems or computing. &#39;Direct Process Control&#39; uses words that imply system management but are not the correct expansion. &#39;Dynamic Program Counter&#39; conflates a kernel mechanism with a CPU register. &#39;Device Port Communication&#39; relates to hardware, which is a different area of OS functionality.",
      "analogy": "Think of a DPC like a &#39;to-do list&#39; for the operating system&#39;s kernel. When something urgent happens (like a network packet arriving), the kernel quickly handles the most critical part and then adds a note to its DPC list to finish the less urgent work later, without delaying other high-priority tasks."
