    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Pattern-based deobfuscation involves searching for specific, known byte patterns (opcodes) that represent obfuscated instructions and replacing them with NOPs or their deobfuscated equivalents. This technique is effective against simple, manually crafted obfuscations with limited pattern diversity. It operates at the syntactic level, making it fast and low-cost. Defense: Modern obfuscators use polymorphism and diversity, making static pattern matching ineffective. Advanced obfuscation techniques generate unique instruction sequences for each execution, rendering fixed patterns useless.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Emulation-based deobfuscation executes the obfuscated code in a virtual environment to observe its true behavior. Symbolic execution explores all possible execution paths of a program to understand its logic. Control flow graph reconstruction analyzes the program&#39;s structure to understand execution paths, which is a prerequisite for many deobfuscation techniques but not the technique itself.",

    ],
    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Qualitative risk analysis relies on the insights and opinions of subject-matter experts. While this can provide unique perspectives that raw data might miss, a significant disadvantage is that these opinions can be heavily influenced by biases stemming from media narratives, peer pressure, or corporate loyalty. These biases can lead to an inaccurate or skewed assessment of risks. To mitigate this, researchers should vet participants for bias, use anonymous submissions, and cross-reference data through multiple interviews and diverse experts.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor describes a characteristic of quantitative analysis, not qualitative. The second distractor points to a practical challenge, not a fundamental flaw in the methodology&#39;s ability to produce accurate results if bias is controlled. The third distractor misrepresents the scope of qualitative analysis, which does aim to assess both likelihood and impact through expert judgment, distinguishing between a &#39;threat&#39; (what can do damage) and &#39;risk&#39; (likelihood and impact of that threat).",

This is a critical component of data governance and reducing an organization&#39;s data footprint, as it mandates the removal of PII upon request, thereby reducing the attack surface for data breaches. For blue teams, understanding and implementing processes for handling these requests is crucial for compliance and minimizing data exposure.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. The right to rectification allows individuals to have inaccurate personal data corrected. The right to restrict processing allows individuals to limit the way an organization uses their data. While all are data subject rights, only the right to erasure specifically addresses the deletion of data.",
