Before restoring, it is paramount to analyze the backup itself to ensure it is clean. Restoring a compromised backup would simply reintroduce the threat, leading to a cycle of re-infection. This analysis might involve scanning the backup image, mounting it in an isolated environment for forensic analysis, or comparing file hashes against known good states.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Immediately restoring prioritizes RTO over security, risking re-infection. Rebuilding the OS is a good practice but doesn&#39;t address potential compromise within the data backup itself. Scanning after restoration is reactive and allows the exploit to reactivate, rather than preventing its reintroduction.",

To ensure a clean recovery, the application must be restored to an environment known to be free of the rootkit. Verifying the backup&#39;s cleanliness is paramount. Implementing NDIS-level monitoring (Network Driver Interface Specification) is crucial because the rootkit bypasses higher-level network monitoring by directly manipulating the TCP/IP stack, but NDIS operates at a lower level, allowing visibility into traffic that the rootkit might attempt to hide.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The distractors represent common but flawed recovery approaches. Restoring without verification or relying on bypassed security tools will likely lead to re-infection.

Multiple AV scans are unlikely to catch a sophisticated rootkit that has already demonstrated evasion capabilities.",
