      "core_logic": "Editcap is a versatile command-line tool within the Wireshark suite specifically designed for manipulating trace files. Its capabilities include altering timestamps, splitting large trace files into smaller sets, removing duplicate packets, and changing the trace file type, making it ideal for pre-processing captured data.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Mergecap is used for combining multiple trace files. Tshark is a command-line capture and display tool, offering lower overhead than the GUI but not focused on file manipulation like splitting or timestamp editing. Capinfos provides statistical information about trace files, such as packet counts and data rates, without modifying the file itself.",
      "analogy": "Editcap is like a video editor for network traffic; you can cut large recordings into smaller clips, adjust the timing of events, or clean up redundant frames."
