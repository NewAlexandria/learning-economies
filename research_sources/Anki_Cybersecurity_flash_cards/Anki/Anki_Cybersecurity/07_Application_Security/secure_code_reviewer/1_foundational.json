    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The decentralized and multi-hop architecture of Wireless Mesh Networks means that data can traverse multiple nodes. This complexity provides opportunities for attackers to insert themselves into the network, impersonate legitimate nodes, or manipulate traffic paths, often without being easily detected due to the distributed nature of the network.",
      "distractor_analysis": "While WMNs do use Wi-Fi, their unique vulnerability lies in the mesh architecture itself, not just the underlying Wi-Fi. The claim about proprietary encryption is generally incorrect, as many WMNs leverage standard security. The high-value target aspect explains motivation but not the inherent architectural weakness.",
      "analogy": "Imagine a traditional network as a single road with a single checkpoint. A mesh network is like a city with many interconnected streets and no central authority; an attacker can set up a fake street sign or detour without anyone at a central point immediately noticing."
