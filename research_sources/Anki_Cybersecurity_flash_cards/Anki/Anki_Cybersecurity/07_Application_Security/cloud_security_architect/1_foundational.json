    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "In modern web applications, SQL operations typically occur on the server-side, past the routing level. The `/client` directory contains client-side code (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) that runs in the user&#39;s browser. While client-side code can be manipulated to craft malicious requests, the direct SQL operations and thus the direct SQL injection vulnerabilities reside on the server-side, making the client-side less critical for *direct* codebase analysis for SQL injection points.",
      "distractor_analysis": "`/api` routes are often direct interfaces to backend services that interact with databases, making them highly critical for SQL injection analysis. `/routes` directories contain server-side routing logic, which frequently dispatches requests to functions that perform database operations. `/analytics` routes, even if built on open-source software, are likely to use a database to store data, making them potential targets for SQL injection.",
      "analogy": "Analyzing the `/client` directory for SQL injection is like checking the car&#39;s dashboard for engine problems – while you can see indicators, the actual engine (server-side) is where the problem originates and needs to be fixed."

    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Prepared statements work by compiling the SQL query first with placeholder values for variables. After compilation, these placeholders are replaced with user-provided values. This two-step process ensures that the intention of the query is set before any user-submitted data is considered, preventing malicious input from altering the query&#39;s structure or intent.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Input validation and sanitization are important for cleaning user data, but they operate before the data reaches the database query. Prepared statements directly address how the query is constructed and executed. WAFs provide a network-level defense, blocking known attack patterns, but prepared statements are an application-level control that prevents the vulnerability from existing. Least privilege limits the damage an attacker can do if an injection is successful, but it doesn&#39;t prevent the injection itself.",
      "analogy": "Prepared statements are like a pre-printed form where you fill in the blanks, ensuring you can only provide specific information in designated spots, rather than writing a whole new letter that could include malicious instructions."
