    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The &#39;machine dependent thread object&#39; holds the actual register state of the thread, which is fundamental for context switching and execution. A kernel-level rootkit aiming to manipulate execution flow or escalate privileges would directly alter this object to control the CPU&#39;s state for that thread, making it the most critical field for detecting such anomalies.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Per-thread statistics track syscall usage but don&#39;t show *how* the thread is executing. Priority values affect scheduling but not the underlying execution state. Ports are for communication and management, not the direct execution context that a rootkit would subvert.",
      "analogy": "If a rootkit is like a puppeteer, the &#39;machine dependent thread object&#39; is the puppet&#39;s strings and internal mechanics. The other fields are more like the puppet&#39;s costume or its performance schedule, which are less direct indicators of manipulation."
