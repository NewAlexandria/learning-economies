        "misconception": "Targets role assignment misunderstanding: The text states &#39;Every engagement has a lead, and that person is the team lead for that engagement regardless of their position in the organization,&#39; implying dynamic, engagement-specific leadership, not permanent seniority-based assignment."

    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The text highlights the use of a ticketing system to manage high-level tasks and ensure nothing is missed, particularly for infrastructure setup and post-engagement cleanup. This system is crucial for maintaining operational integrity and accountability, especially during transitions to incident response.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The text explicitly states that &#39;position outweighs rank for tactical decisions,&#39; making the strict hierarchy distractor incorrect. While Slack is used for communication, a ticketing system is specifically mentioned for task management, making the &#39;relying solely on Slack&#39; distractor inaccurate. The text also clarifies that engagement leads are assigned based on the engagement itself, &#39;regardless of their position in the organization,&#39; refuting the idea of permanent, seniority-based leads.",
      "analogy": "Using a ticketing system is like a construction project manager using a detailed work order system to track every major phase and ensure all tasks, from foundation pouring to final cleanup, are completed and accounted for, especially if the project needs to pause or shift focus."
