Security by Design is a development methodology, and CI/CD is a deployment practice, neither directly addresses the specific principles for defining permissions as requested.",
      "analogy": "Implementing PoLP and RBAC is like giving a chef only the keys to the kitchen, not the entire restaurant, and then further restricting their access within the kitchen based on their specific role (e.g., pastry chef vs. line cook). It ensures they have exactly what they need, and nothing more, to perform their job."

      "core_logic": "The document emphasizes that an effective blue team adopts a global, collaborative mindset, mirroring attackers&#39; strategies. It highlights the importance of information sharing across the industry to learn from breaches and prevent similar incidents. This &#39;big picture&#39; approach moves beyond isolated defense to a collective effort.",
      "distractor_analysis": "An effective blue team does not solely focus on internal perimeter defense but thinks globally and shares information. While rapid incident response is crucial, the text advocates for adding proactive measures like threat hunting and cyber-threat intelligence. Relying only on traditional DFIR is seen as insufficient, with a call to integrate cloud security and threat hunting.",
      "analogy": "An effective blue team is like a global neighborhood watch, where everyone shares information about burglaries in their area so that others can better protect their homes, rather than each house trying to defend itself in isolation."
