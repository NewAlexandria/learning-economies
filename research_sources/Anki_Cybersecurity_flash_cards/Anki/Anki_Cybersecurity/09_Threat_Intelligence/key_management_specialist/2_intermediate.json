To counter this, blue teams need capabilities that can automatically identify and alert on the misuse of trusted applications. This requires behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Additionally, cloud-enabled log management platforms are crucial for efficient incident response and forensic investigations, providing scalability, centralized visibility, and easier access to critical data for analysis.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Signature-based antivirus is ineffective against malware-free attacks, and on-premise SIEMs can lack the scalability and accessibility of cloud solutions. Manual threat hunting is valuable but not a &#39;core capability&#39; for automation, and isolated forensic workstations hinder collaborative and scalable investigations. NIPS and physical access controls are important security layers but do not directly address the specific challenge of detecting misuse of trusted applications or modernizing log management for incident response in the context of fileless attacks.",

You need smart cameras that recognize unusual behavior (automated misuse detection) and a central control room that records everything and lets you quickly review footage from anywhere (cloud-enabled log management), rather than just checking for known faces (signatures) or having separate security guards for each room (isolated forensics)."
