    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Threat simulation broadly tests an organization&#39;s defenses (people, processes, technology) against a range of attack techniques and goals. Threat emulation is a more specific form of testing that aims to replicate the exact tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of a known, specific threat actor, often requiring detailed threat intelligence.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor incorrectly implies a continuous process for emulation. The second distractor reverses the scope, as simulation explicitly includes people and processes. The third distractor incorrectly suggests zero-day discovery as a primary goal for emulation, which is not its focus.",
      "analogy": "Threat simulation is like a general fire drill testing overall preparedness, while threat emulation is like practicing for a specific type of fire known to be started by a particular arsonist, using their exact methods."
