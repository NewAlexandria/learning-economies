    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The initial and critical step in coverage analysis for an RF site survey is to conduct site coverage and capacity-planning interviews. These interviews gather essential information about population density, application requirements, and roaming needs, which directly inform decisions about cell size and access point placement.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Deploying access points at maximum power is explicitly warned against due to performance and security issues. While specialized tools are useful later, initial coverage analysis can be done with basic 802.11-enabled devices. Setting access points to 100 megawatts by default is incorrect and can cause significant interference.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like designing a building: before you lay a single brick, you interview the future occupants to understand their needs, how many people will be there, and what activities they&#39;ll perform. This informs the blueprint, just as interviews inform the RF design."
