      }
    ],
    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Setting AP power levels too high during WLAN coverage analysis, or in general, is detrimental because it can lead to significant performance degradation due to increased signal interference with neighboring APs. More critically from a security perspective, it extends the wireless signal&#39;s reach beyond the intended coverage area, making the network more vulnerable to eavesdropping and unauthorized access from a wider physical perimeter.",
      "distractor_analysis": "While power consumption is a factor for any electronic device, it&#39;s not the primary reason cited for avoiding high AP power in the context of performance and security. Hardware damage from overheating is generally not a direct consequence of high power settings in modern APs, which are designed to operate within specified ranges. Regulatory fines are a compliance concern, but the immediate technical and security implications of interference and extended signal range are more pertinent to network performance and vulnerability.",
      "analogy": "Think of shouting in a crowded room. If everyone shouts (high power), no one can understand each other (interference, performance issues). Also, if you shout too loudly, people outside the room can hear your private conversation (increased security vulnerability)."
