      "core_logic": "The &#39;verify explicitly&#39; principle in Zero Trust demands that all access requests and system states are authenticated and authorized based on all available data points, not just implicit trust. In the context of memory forensics, VAD analysis provides explicit, detailed information about how a process&#39;s memory is structured, allocated, and protected. By examining VAD flags like `CommitChange`, `PrivateMemory`, and `Protection`, forensic analysts can explicitly verify if memory regions are legitimately allocated, if their permissions are appropriate, and if there are any suspicious modifications or hidden regions, thus verifying the integrity of the process&#39;s memory state.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The principle of &#39;verify explicitly&#39; is about the rigor and detail of the verification process itself, not just who can access the forensic data. While automation is valuable, it&#39;s the explicit nature of the data being verified that aligns with the principle. Micro-segmentation applies to network or application boundaries, not the internal structure of a process&#39;s virtual memory.",
      "analogy": "If &#39;verify explicitly&#39; is like a customs agent checking every detail on your passport and travel documents, VAD analysis is like that agent scrutinizing every stamp, every visa, and every entry/exit record to explicitly confirm your travel history and legitimacy, rather than just glancing at your photo."
