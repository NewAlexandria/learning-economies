The immediate priority is to determine if an actual incident is occurring. Given MAC filtering is in place, verifying the MAC address and looking for spoofing indicators (as MAC filtering is easily bypassed) is crucial to confirm if it&#39;s an unauthorized device or a legitimate one with an issue.",
