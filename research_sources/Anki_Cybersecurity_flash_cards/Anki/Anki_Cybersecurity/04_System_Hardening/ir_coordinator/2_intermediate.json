    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The team is in the Identification phase because they are trying to determine the root cause of the &#39;RPC Server is unavailable&#39; error after initial log analysis failed. Deploying a network capture tool like Wireshark to monitor traffic is a critical step in identifying network-related issues, especially when logs are inconclusive, as demonstrated in the case study where it revealed the Kerberos UDP to TCP issue.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Blocking traffic (Containment) is premature without understanding the issue&#39;s scope and nature. Deleting and recreating accounts (Eradication) is a temporary workaround, not a solution, and doesn&#39;t identify the root cause. Restoring the server (Recovery) is also premature, as the problem&#39;s origin is unknown, and it could lead to data loss or re-occurrence of the issue.",
      "analogy": "Like a detective finding a locked door (the error message) and, after checking the obvious keys (logs) without success, deciding to look for hidden clues around the doorframe or listen for sounds behind it (network traffic analysis) before trying to break it down (containment/eradication)."
