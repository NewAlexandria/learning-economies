Disabling remote access to the router removes a significant attack vector, as attackers cannot attempt to log in from outside the network. Blocking unknown incoming connections further reduces the attack surface. Network segmentation, through a Guest Wi-Fi network for untrusted devices and a separate VLAN for sensitive devices, isolates potential threats and prevents lateral movement in case of a breach.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Enabling UPnP creates security holes. A single network increases the blast radius. Relying solely on strong passwords is insufficient. Disabling the firewall is a critical security lapse. Enabling remote access is a major risk. MAC address filtering is easily bypassed. Blocking only outgoing connections ignores inbound threats. Keeping all devices on one network defeats segmentation. Password changes are good but not a substitute for firewall rules.",
