      "core_logic": "The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field contains a Cyclic Redundancy Checksum (CRC). This CRC is calculated by the sending station and recalculated by the receiving station. If the two CRCs match, it indicates that the data in the frame survived its transmission over the network intact, thus verifying data transmission accuracy and integrity. This is a critical control for ensuring data has not been corrupted during transit.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The Preamble is used for signal synchronization at the start of a frame, not for data integrity. The Source Address identifies the sender of the frame, which is important for network communication but does not verify the integrity of the data payload. The Type/Length Field indicates the higher-level protocol being carried or the length of the data, neither of which directly verifies data integrity.",
