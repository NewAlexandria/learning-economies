    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The question describes the need for a documented, tested, and validated process for evidence extraction. While not immediately obvious, this falls under supply chain risk management in NIST CSF 2.0 because the &#39;supply chain&#39; here refers to the chain of custody and integrity of the evidence itself, which is a critical input to any forensic investigation. Ensuring the reliability and documentation of the extraction process is a form of managing risk within this &#39;supply chain&#39; of evidence. The SANS resource link also points to a &#39;process&#39; document, reinforcing the idea of managing the integrity of the forensic process as a supply chain element.",
