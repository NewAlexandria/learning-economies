While this leads to unused bandwidth, its primary goal is network stability and availability.",

However, they were developed *after* STP and for different primary purposes (load balancing, multipathing) rather than the original problem of basic loop prevention in Layer 2 networks. ECMP operates at Layer 3, while SPB and TRILL are Layer 2 technologies that provide more advanced multipathing than STP.",

    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Spread spectrum techniques, by design, spread their signal across a much wider frequency band compared to narrowband. This wide distribution makes it significantly harder for an attacker to jam the entire signal effectively. Additionally, spread spectrum signals typically use lower power, which further reduces the risk of interference and makes them less susceptible to detection and jamming. Narrowband, in contrast, uses a tight frequency band and higher power, making it easier to target and jam.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Narrowband is the opposite, being highly susceptible to jamming. FHSS is a specific implementation of spread spectrum, but &#39;Spread spectrum&#39; is the more general and direct answer to the inherent property. High-power licensed transmission describes characteristics of narrowband, which is less resistant to jamming and requires licensing due to its interference potential.",
      "analogy": "Imagine trying to hit a single, small target (narrowband) versus trying to hit a target that&#39;s constantly moving and spread across a huge area (spread spectrum). The latter is much harder to hit consistently."

      "distractor_analysis": "Data integrity is ensured by mechanisms like Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or digital signatures, which detect tampering, not by encryption itself. User authentication verifies the identity of users or devices, which is a prerequisite for establishing a secure, encrypted channel but distinct from the encryption&#39;s function.
