This benefit often includes reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk, which can be quantified in terms of avoided losses, regulatory compliance, or reputational protection. While the cost should ideally also be less than the asset&#39;s value, the direct comparison of cost to benefit is a more comprehensive measure of a countermeasure&#39;s economic viability.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The distractor stating the cost should always be less than the asset&#39;s value is plausible but incomplete. While often true, the benefit can encompass more than just the direct asset value (e.g., preventing regulatory fines, maintaining customer trust), making the cost-benefit comparison more robust. The option about availability and ease of implementation misprioritizes selection criteria, as effective countermeasures should address identified problems and pass a cost-benefit analysis first. The distractor suggesting benefit depends on secrecy promotes security through obscurity, which is generally considered a weak security practice; robust countermeasures should be effective even if their mechanisms are known.",
      "analogy": "Choosing a security countermeasure is like buying insurance. You wouldn&#39;t pay more for the insurance policy than the car is worth (cost vs. asset value), but you also want the premium (cost) to be less than the potential financial loss you&#39;d incur without it (benefit of avoiding loss). The benefit isn&#39;t just the car&#39;s value, but also avoiding legal fees, medical bills, and inconvenience."

Beneficial uses include network management and customized user experiences, while malicious uses include aggressive advertising and cyberstalking.",

The second distractor focuses solely on the beneficial aspects for network administrators, ignoring the potential for misuse.

The specific encryption protocols distractor focuses too narrowly on a technical detail, overlooking broader management practices. The PCI-DSS audit distractor incorrectly assumes universal applicability of a specific regulatory audit to all wireless networks, rather than a general security management practice.",

You regularly check the oil (firmware upgrades), lock the doors (physical security), know where your car is (periodic inventory), and watch out for strange noises (rogue WLANs).
