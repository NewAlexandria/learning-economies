This method avoids complex lookups in routing tables, speeding up traffic flow and enabling more sophisticated traffic engineering, such as setting up explicit paths for different types of traffic (e.g., delay-sensitive vs. throughput-sensitive applications). It operates between Layer 2 (Data Link) and Layer 3 (Network) of the OSI model.",

While MPLS can be part of a secure network design, its core function is not encryption. The &#39;replace TCP/IP&#39; distractor overstates MPLS&#39;s role; MPLS works with and enhances IP routing, it doesn&#39;t replace the entire suite. The wireless authentication distractor is completely out of scope for MPLS, which is primarily a WAN/core network technology, not a LAN wireless access control mechanism.",

MPLS is like an express courier service where, once a package enters the system, it gets a simple, short label that tells each handler exactly where to send it next without needing to re-read the full address, making delivery much faster and more predictable."

A hardware write blocker provides a physical, verifiable barrier against any write operations to the evidence drive. While a Linux-based forensic CD is designed to minimize writes, it cannot guarantee absolute protection against all scenarios, such as accidental mounting with write permissions, kernel bugs, or even malicious software. Regulatory frameworks like HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI-DSS, while not directly mandating write blockers, implicitly require the preservation of data integrity during investigations to ensure the admissibility of evidence and to avoid further data compromise. Failure to use a write blocker could lead to questions about the evidence&#39;s integrity, potentially invalidating findings in legal or compliance contexts.",
      "distractor_analysis": "The first distractor, suggesting a Linux CD inherently prevents writes, is plausible because many forensic Linux distributions are designed to be read-only. However, it&#39;s a generalization that doesn&#39;t account for all scenarios or potential misconfigurations. The second distractor, relying solely on imaging software configuration, is flawed because software can have bugs or be misconfigured, and a hardware write blocker offers a more robust, independent layer of protection. The third distractor incorrectly links the necessity of a write blocker to the type of data (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS). While these regulations emphasize data integrity, the use of a write blocker is a fundamental forensic best practice for ALL evidence, not just regulated data, to maintain chain of custody and admissibility.",

Even if you trust the person handling it (the Linux OS), the seal (write blocker) provides an independent, physical guarantee that no changes were made, which is crucial for legal and regulatory scrutiny."

The traffic lights and signs (routing) then enforce these city-wide policies, rather than just optimizing for the shortest physical distance."

The usable window `W` is calculated as `min(cwnd + dwnd, awnd)`. This `dwnd` component allows CTCP to be more aggressive and utilize available bandwidth more effectively when network delays indicate underutilization, while still reacting to packet loss like standard TCP. The `dwnd` is managed based on measured RTT and a `diff` variable, aiming to keep network queue occupancy at a desired threshold (`γ`).",

The second distractor is factually wrong; CTCP is not the default on most Windows versions (except Windows Server 2008) and is not included by default in Linux. The third distractor misrepresents `dwnd` management; `dwnd` is increased when `diff &lt; γ` (network underutilized/delay is low relative to `baseRTT`), and decreased when `diff ≥ γ` (network congested/delay is high), not primarily reduced when RTT decreases.",
