    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "An aggregating tap combines bi-directional (full-duplex) traffic from a network link into a single outbound port. This allows a monitoring device, such as a computer running Wireshark, to capture all traffic on that link using only one network interface card, which perfectly matches the requirement of a single Wireshark instance and a single NIC.",
      "distractor_analysis": "A non-aggregating tap outputs full-duplex traffic on two separate ports, requiring two NICs or two separate monitoring devices. A regenerating tap duplicates traffic to multiple monitoring ports, useful for multiple tools but not specifically for single-NIC full-duplex capture. A link aggregation tap is designed to combine traffic from multiple *network links* (e.g., multiple servers) into one or more monitoring ports, which is a different use case than monitoring a single full-duplex link with one NIC.",
      "analogy": "Think of an aggregating tap like a funnel that takes water flowing in two directions (full-duplex traffic) and combines it into a single stream (single output port) for collection. A non-aggregating tap would be like two separate hoses, each carrying one direction of flow."

      "distractor_analysis": "`tcp.flags.syn == 1 &amp;&amp; tcp.flags.ack == 0` identifies SYN packets, often used in port scanning, but not directly related to TTL. `http.request.method == &quot;GET&quot;` filters for HTTP GET requests, which is an application-layer filter and irrelevant to an IP-layer TTL condition. `icmp.type == 8` filters for ICMP echo requests (ping), which is a different protocol and not the specific signature based on TTL.",
