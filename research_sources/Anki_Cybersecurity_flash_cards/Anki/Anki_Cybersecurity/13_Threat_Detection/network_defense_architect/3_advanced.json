      "core_logic": "3-way partitioning, also known as the Dutch National Flag problem solution, partitions the array into three sections: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. This approach efficiently handles duplicate keys by placing all equal elements into their final sorted position in a single pass, significantly reducing the number of comparisons and exchanges for these elements and preventing quadratic performance in scenarios with many duplicates.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Standard 2-way partitioning with random shuffling is crucial for preventing worst-case quadratic time but doesn&#39;t specifically optimize for duplicate keys. Cutoff to insertion sort is a general optimization for small subarrays, not for duplicate keys. Median-of-three partitioning improves pivot selection but isn&#39;t designed to handle large numbers of duplicate keys as efficiently as 3-way partitioning.",
      "analogy": "Imagine sorting a deck of cards where many cards have the same value. 3-way partitioning is like quickly separating all the &#39;7s&#39; into their own pile, then sorting the cards smaller than &#39;7&#39; and larger than &#39;7&#39; separately, rather than repeatedly comparing each &#39;7&#39; against other &#39;7s&#39;."

This combination allows for a comprehensive understanding of network traffic behavior, crucial for identifying previously unseen attack vectors in SDN.",

Fully Connected DNNs are general-purpose and lack the specialized capabilities of CNNs for spatial patterns and LSTMs for temporal sequences. Autoencoders with RNN layers are strong for unsupervised anomaly detection and feature extraction but are not explicitly designed to capture both spatial and temporal features in the same way a CNN-LSTM hybrid is for zero-day attack detection.",
