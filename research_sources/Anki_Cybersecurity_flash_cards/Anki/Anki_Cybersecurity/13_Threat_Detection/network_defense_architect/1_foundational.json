Distractor 3 proposes segmentation, a good practice, but without logs, monitoring traffic within and between segments is difficult.",

      "core_logic": "For a primitive security infrastructure, the most effective initial step is to establish a strategic foundation. Adopting a recognized framework like NIST CSF provides a structured approach to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover, ensuring that security efforts are comprehensive, aligned with best practices, and scalable as the organization grows. This framework guides policy development and secure system engineering, which are prerequisites for effective tool deployment and user training.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Distractor 1 suggests deploying tools without a guiding framework, which can lead to inefficient and uncoordinated security. Distractor 2 focuses on only one aspect (user training) while ignoring infrastructure and policy. Distractor 3 proposes an advanced solution (micro-segmentation) that is likely premature and unsustainable for a primitive environment without foundational policies and resources.",
      "analogy": "Like building a house: you start with a blueprint (framework) and a strong foundation (policies) before buying furniture (tools) or teaching occupants how to use the appliances (user training)."
