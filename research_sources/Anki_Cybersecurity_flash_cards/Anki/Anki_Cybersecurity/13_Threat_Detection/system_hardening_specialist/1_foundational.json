EDR solutions, while powerful, are typically beyond the &#39;immediate&#39; and &#39;primitive infrastructure&#39; scope for a single staff member with no budget. NIDS focuses on network traffic, not the host-based logging emphasized for immediate visibility on individual systems.",

AI-based platforms like Darktrace are for detection and anomaly identification, but the actual blocking action for rogue APs is typically handled by network firewalls or WIPS. IDS/IPS tools like Snort or Suricata are designed to block suspicious traffic based on signatures or anomalies, but their primary function isn&#39;t specifically to block rogue APs, which are often identified by their physical presence or MAC address rather than just traffic patterns.",
