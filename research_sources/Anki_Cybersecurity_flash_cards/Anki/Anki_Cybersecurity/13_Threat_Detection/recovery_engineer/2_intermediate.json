    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "A regenerating tap is specifically designed to duplicate network traffic from a single link to multiple outbound monitoring ports. This allows multiple tools, such as Wireshark for detailed analysis and Snort for intrusion detection, to simultaneously receive an identical copy of the traffic without interfering with each other or requiring complex splitting solutions. This is crucial for comprehensive security monitoring and incident response where different tools serve different analytical purposes.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Non-aggregating taps provide two separate streams (transmit/receive) requiring two NICs or devices, not ideal for multiple tools from a single stream. Aggregating taps combine bi-directional traffic into one stream, suitable for one monitoring device. Link aggregation taps monitor multiple *links*, which is a different use case than duplicating a single link&#39;s traffic for multiple tools.",
      "analogy": "Think of a regenerating tap like a power strip with multiple outlets for different appliances, all drawing power from the same source. Each monitoring tool gets its own &#39;outlet&#39; for the network traffic."
