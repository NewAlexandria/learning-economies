Disabling these allows for easier testing of exploit payloads before focusing on bypass techniques.",

A firewall controls network traffic, not memory execution.

SmartScreen protects against malicious downloads/websites, and BitLocker encrypts the disk, neither of which are the primary memory protections targeted for disabling in this scenario.",

      "core_logic": "For an XSS vulnerability to be exploitable, two key components are required: a &#39;sink&#39; and a &#39;source&#39;. The sink is a browser method (like `eval()` or `innerHTML`) that can execute script. The source is where the attacker&#39;s text-based payload originates (e.g., `window.location.hash` or `document.referrer`) before being read and executed by the sink.",
      "distractor_analysis": "An input field and a database are too general; XSS specifically requires browser-side execution components. Server-side scripts and client-side parsers describe how web pages are built, not the specific XSS exploit mechanism. A vulnerable API endpoint and a malicious JavaScript library are specific attack vectors, but the fundamental components for XSS are still the sink and source within the browser environment.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a gun: the &#39;source&#39; is the bullet (the malicious payload), and the &#39;sink&#39; is the firing mechanism (the browser method that executes it). Both are needed for the &#39;shot&#39; (the XSS exploit) to occur."
