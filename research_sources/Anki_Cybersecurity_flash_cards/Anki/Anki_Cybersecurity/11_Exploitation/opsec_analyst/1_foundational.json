    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is notoriously insecure primarily due to its use of weak Initialization Vectors (IVs) and its susceptibility to ARP injection attacks. The small, predictable IVs lead to frequent reuse of key streams, making it possible to recover the WEP key by collecting enough data packets and performing statistical analysis. ARP injection attacks accelerate this process by forcing the access point to generate a large number of encrypted packets, which can then be analyzed to deduce the WEP key.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Advanced cryptographic flaws in AES are not relevant to WEP; AES is used in more modern protocols like WPA2/3. Brute-forcing strong PSKs is a technique used against WPA/WPA2, where the PSK is the primary secret, not WEP. WPS PIN vulnerabilities are a separate attack vector against Wi-Fi Protected Setup, which is distinct from WEP&#39;s core cryptographic weaknesses.",
      "analogy": "Cracking WEP is like trying to pick a lock where the lock mechanism is visible and the same few pins are used repeatedly. An ARP injection attack is like shaking the door handle vigorously to make the lock mechanism move more, giving you more chances to see the pin positions."
