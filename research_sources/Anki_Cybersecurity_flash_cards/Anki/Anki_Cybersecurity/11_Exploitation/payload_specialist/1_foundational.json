      "core_logic": "A Malicious Rogue AP is intentionally set up by an attacker to deceive users into connecting, often by mimicking a legitimate network&#39;s SSID. The primary goal is to intercept traffic, steal credentials, or inject malicious payloads, as exemplified by an Evil Twin attack.",
      "distractor_analysis": "An employee connecting a personal router is an &#39;Accidental Rogue AP.&#39; An IT administrator deploying an insecure AP is a &#39;Misconfigured AP.&#39; A vulnerable legitimate AP is not a rogue AP; it&#39;s a compromised part of the authorized infrastructure.",
      "analogy": "Like a con artist setting up a fake ATM that looks exactly like a real bank&#39;s ATM to steal card details, rather than an employee accidentally leaving a real ATM unlocked."
