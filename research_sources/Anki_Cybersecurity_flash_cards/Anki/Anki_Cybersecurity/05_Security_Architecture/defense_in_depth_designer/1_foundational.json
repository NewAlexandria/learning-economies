    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Fail-secure is a critical defense-in-depth principle. When a system or component fails, it should default to a state that denies access or functionality, thereby maintaining a high level of security. This prevents unauthorized access or compromise during a failure event, acting as a compensating control for unexpected system behavior.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Fail-open would grant access or functionality upon failure, which is the opposite of a secure state. Fail mitigation is a broad term for reducing risk, not a specific failure management approach. Fail-clear is not a recognized term in this context.",
      "analogy": "Imagine a bank vault door. If its electronic locking mechanism fails, you want it to remain locked (fail-secure), not swing open (fail-open)."
