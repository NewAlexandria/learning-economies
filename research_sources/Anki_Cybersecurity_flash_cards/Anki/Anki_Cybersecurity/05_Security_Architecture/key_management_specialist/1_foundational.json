      "core_logic": "Mandatory sandboxing of applications is the core Android security feature that isolates each application in its own environment. This prevents applications from interacting with each other&#39;s data or resources directly, thereby limiting unauthorized access and containing potential malware.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Security at the OS Linux kernel provides the foundational layer for security, including interprocess communication control, but sandboxing is the specific mechanism for application isolation. User-granted application permissions control what resources an app can access (e.g., camera, contacts) but don&#39;t prevent direct interaction between apps themselves. Digital signing identifies the application author and helps deter malware, but it doesn&#39;t enforce runtime isolation between applications.",
      "analogy": "Think of each application as being in its own separate, locked room within a building. Sandboxing is the physical walls and locks that prevent occupants of one room from entering another without explicit permission. User-granted permissions are like giving a specific room occupant a key to a shared resource, like a water fountain, but not to another person&#39;s room."
