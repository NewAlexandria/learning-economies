      "core_logic": "The concept of &#39;simulating human reasoning through a knowledge-based AI system&#39; describes an advanced capability or a type of adversary, rather than a specific, observable MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique or Atomic Red Team testable action. Atomic Red Team tests focus on specific Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that adversaries use, such as &#39;Credential Dumping&#39; or &#39;Process Injection.&#39; While an AI system might *employ* these TTPs, the AI itself is not a TTP that can be directly emulated by a single Atomic Test. Detection would focus on the TTPs the AI executes, not the AI&#39;s internal reasoning process.",

T1078.003 is an authentication bypass, T1562.001 is defensive evasion, and T1059.003 is command execution. None of these directly test the presence or function of an AI reasoning system itself.",
      "analogy": "Asking for an Atomic Red Team test for &#39;simulating human reasoning&#39; is like asking for a test for &#39;a human attacker&#39; – it&#39;s too broad.

    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "Aggregation in databases refers to combining low-level data to infer higher-level, often sensitive, information. Detecting this typically involves database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions, user behavior analytics (UBA), or custom logging and alerting on query patterns (e.g., number of rows returned, frequency of queries across different tables, or specific JOIN operations). Atomic Red Team focuses on system-level attack techniques, not logical data access patterns within a database. Therefore, a direct Atomic Test for &#39;aggregation&#39; as described does not exist.",
      "distractor_analysis": "LSASS memory dumping (T1003.001) is for credential access. PowerShell execution (T1059.001) is a general execution technique.

      "analogy": "Detecting aggregation is like noticing someone reading many individual pages from different books in a library to piece together a secret story, rather than detecting them breaking into the library (which Atomic Red Team would cover)."
