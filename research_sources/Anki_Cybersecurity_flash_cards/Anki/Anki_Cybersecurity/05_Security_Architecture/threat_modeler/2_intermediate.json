      "core_logic": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP) in STRIDE refers to an attacker gaining capabilities or access beyond what they are authorized for. In this scenario, bypassing user-granted permissions to access the contact list means the application (or the attacker through it) has elevated its privileges to access a protected resource without proper authorization. The key is the unauthorized bypass of a security control.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Information Disclosure is a consequence, but the root threat is the unauthorized privilege gain. Tampering would involve modifying the contact list, not just accessing it. Spoofing would involve impersonating the user or another application to trick the system, which is not explicitly described here as the primary attack vector for gaining access.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a guest in your house (the application) finding a hidden key to your locked safe (the contact list) and opening it, even though you only gave them permission to use the living room. The act of finding and using the hidden key to access a restricted area is the &#39;elevation of privilege&#39;."

      "distractor_analysis": "Spoofing relates to impersonation, which these features don&#39;t directly prevent. While BitLocker helps prevent Information Disclosure, its encryption also prevents unauthorized modification, making Tampering a more encompassing answer for both features. Denial of Service is about making resources unavailable, which is not the primary function of these specific features.",
      "analogy": "Think of BitLocker like a tamper-evident seal on a package—it not only hides the contents but also shows if anyone has tried to open or change them.
