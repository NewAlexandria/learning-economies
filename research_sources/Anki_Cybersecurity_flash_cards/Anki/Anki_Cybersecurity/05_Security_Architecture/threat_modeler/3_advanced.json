    "detailed_explanation": {
      "core_logic": "The policy compiler translates high-level, human-readable policies into low-level rules that are then deployed to enforcement points like SDN controllers and NFVI managers. If a threat actor compromises the policy compiler, they can inject malicious low-level rules during this translation process. These malicious rules would then be deployed as legitimate policies, effectively bypassing security controls at a foundational level.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Directly modifying high-level policies is a possibility if they are stored insecurely, but the policy compiler acts as a critical intermediary. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the SDN controller or NFVI manager is a post-deployment attack, assuming the rules are already deployed. Impersonating an authorized application is an authorization threat, but doesn&#39;t directly involve injecting malicious rules into the policy compilation and deployment process.",
      "analogy": "Imagine a chef (administrator) writes a recipe (high-level policy). A sous-chef (policy compiler) translates it into specific cooking instructions (low-level rules) for the kitchen staff (SDN controller/NFVI manager). If an attacker bribes the sous-chef, they can secretly add poison to the instructions, even if the original recipe was harmless."
