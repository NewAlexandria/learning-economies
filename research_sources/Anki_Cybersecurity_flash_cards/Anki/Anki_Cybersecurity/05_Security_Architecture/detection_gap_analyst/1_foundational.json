This isolation prevents them from interacting with each other directly without explicit mechanisms and limits their access to the underlying operating system, thereby containing potential malicious activity.",
      "distractor_analysis": "Identifying application authors and deterring malware is the role of digital signing. While the Linux kernel does constrain native code, sandboxing provides a broader isolation for all applications, not just native code, and prevents inter-app interaction. Providing secure mechanisms for accessing file systems is a function of secure interprocess communication, not sandboxing itself.",
      "analogy": "Think of mandatory sandboxing as giving each application its own separate, sealed room within the device. They can&#39;t peek into other rooms or directly mess with the building&#39;s foundation (OS) without specific, approved channels."
