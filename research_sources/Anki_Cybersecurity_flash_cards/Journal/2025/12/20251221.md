## Introduction

Every new creation is a mirrored reflection of the last but with a twist.

The number 3 is symbolic of completion, so it is only right for us to finish off our language journey with a 3rd repository dedicated to the art of learning as a language.

## The Trilogy

Our journey initiated with **Language Learning**, with which our ideas were then passed on to **Learning As A Language**, and from there arose this new repository **The Art Of Language**.

1. **Language Learning** - The initiation
2. **Learning As A Language** - The passing
3. **The Art Of Language** - The rising

## Reflection

During this journey of Learning As A Language, I have come to realize that ignorance is truly bliss. Often times, I wonder why should I spend my time creating these repositories and providing my findings to people who may only be looking for shortcuts. Or people who may be unwilling to endure the fire of change. But this thinking is just a self-imposed fallacy with the assumption that all people have bad intentions.

Truly, the reason why I wish to spread my knowledge is the thought that maybe sometime in the near future the seeds that I plant now will grow and my ideas will help push the boundaries of modern day philosophy.

## Conclusion

I will continue to offer my gift of **VISION**

I will continue to **POINT THE WAY!**
