### 6. Other Supplementary Matters

(1) This project uses electronic bidding. Suppliers must log in to the Government Procurement Cloud platform to obtain procurement documents and use the Government Procurement Cloud electronic bidding client to prepare response documents; all costs related to bidding are borne by the supplier.

(2) Suppliers must, before bid opening, be registered as suppliers on the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Government Procurement Network and complete CA digital certificate application. Consequences of failure to register or obtain a CA certificate (including inability to bid or failed bid) are borne by the supplier.

(3) Suppliers wishing to participate in electronic bid opening in Xinjiang may visit the Xinjiang Digital Certificate Authentication Center (https://www.xjca.com.cn/) or download the “Xinjiang Government Services” app. For inquiries: Xinjiang CA service hotline 0991-2819290.

(4) Suppliers may download the Government Procurement Cloud electronic bidding client from the Xinjiang Government Procurement Network (http://www.ccgp-xinjiang.gov.cn/). Windows 7 or above is recommended. For issues, call Government Procurement Cloud customer service 95763.

(5) This project uses “non-face-to-face” bid opening. Suppliers must upload encrypted electronic response documents via CA on the Government Procurement Cloud platform before the bid deadline. For system help: https://edu.zcygov.cn/luban/xinjiang-e-biding and https://service.zcygov.cn/#/help (“Project Procurement”—“E-bidding”—“Supplier Operation Guide”). Unresolved issues may be addressed via DingTalk group or Government Procurement Cloud online customer service.

Suppliers must use a valid CA key to decrypt within the allotted time; failure to decrypt is deemed withdrawal of the response.

(8) Late or incorrectly submitted response documents will not be accepted.

**Procurement budget:** CNY 3.7 million

### 2. Project Description

The Information Engineering Department of Xinjiang Police College offers undergraduate programs in “Cybersecurity and Law Enforcement” and “Cyberspace Security.” Aligned with program objectives and with the aim of enhancing students’ practical innovation and career development in cybersecurity, the project will build a cyberspace security comprehensive laboratory. The lab will support collaboration with domestic cybersecurity enterprises in experimental practice, comprehensive training, second classroom, innovation and entrepreneurship, and skills competitions, and establish a long-term industry-education integration mechanism.

The project requires a virtualized, practice-oriented teaching environment comprising: a cyberspace security teaching platform with supporting practice courses and a practical teaching resource repository; a network attack-defense platform including competition tasks and training services; an integrated AI platform and courses; servers, student PCs, and other hardware/software; and fit-out of four training rooms. Upon completion, the project shall: support lab sessions for cybersecurity-related courses under the current talent development plans of both majors; support 2–3 week concentrated practice (e.g. comprehensive training, second classroom); support 10-week professional internship or other large scenario-based comprehensive practice; and enable cybersecurity competitions, network confrontation, and attack-defense exercises on the platform. Through lectures, case studies, hands-on labs, simulated confrontation, and competitions, the project will improve the attack-defense capabilities of faculty and students, broaden practical channels, enrich training pathways, and encourage more students to participate, thereby raising the core competitiveness of the programs.

## Part VII  Evaluation Methods and Detailed Rules

*Per Government Procurement Law, Ministry of Finance Order No. 87, and relevant regulations; principles: fairness, openness, science, merit-based selection.*

### I. General Provisions

- The evaluation committee shall evaluate strictly per the document and prepare a report; members shall keep confidentiality and avoid conflicts.
- The committee shall check each bid for compliance, completeness, and validity (qualification, main technical parameters, commercial price, other factors). Deviations shall be verified and noted; material deviations may lead to rejection (with opportunity to respond on non-material points).
- **Method:** Comprehensive scoring. The bidder with the highest total score (meeting all substantive requirements) is recommended as the winning candidate. Price score uses “low price priority”: the lowest compliant bid is the benchmark (full price score). Formula: *Bid price score = (Benchmark price / Bid price) × Price weight × 100%*. Total score = weighted sum of factors (weights sum to 1). Do not drop highest or lowest price. Recommend at least 3 candidates in score order; same score then by lower price (or technical merit or draw).
- Supervision group and organization support the process; the evaluation committee (5 members, including 1 purchaser representative and 4 experts from the Xinjiang expert pool) performs initial and detailed review and recommendation.

### II–IV. Composition and Functions; Evaluation Principles; Discipline

*(Standard roles of supervision, organization, and evaluation committee; fairness and independence; no contact with bidders during evaluation.)*

### V. Evaluation Procedure

**5.1 Initial review and price check**

- Check all bids for *major* deviations. Major deviations (non-response) include: no/invalid bid bond; no authorization; no seal/signature; does not meet qualification; price over budget/ceiling; completion period over limit; name/structure inconsistent; same legal representative/affiliates bidding; validity insufficient; material departure from main terms; bribery/fraud/collusion; disorder; unacceptable conditions; other invalid cases. One major deviation → bid rejected.
- Minor deviations (incomplete but correctable without unfairness) do not invalidate the bid; the committee may require correction before result.
- Calculation errors: unit price prevails over total; words prevail over figures for amounts. Unwillingness to accept correction may lead to rejection.
- Clarification in writing may be requested; may not go beyond the bid or change substance. Refusal to clarify may lead to rejection.
- Response is judged only from the bid itself. Collusion, fraud, or bribery → rejection. All bids may be rejected if all non-compliant or all prices too high, or if fewer than 3 valid bids and competition is insufficient.

**5.2 Detailed review**

- Compliant bids are further evaluated and compared per the scoring criteria.

**5.3 Scoring**

- **Economic (price): 30 points.** No floor price. Benchmark = lowest compliant bid (full score). Others: *Score = (Benchmark / Bid price) × 30 × 100%* (two decimal places). Negative score = 0.
- **Commercial/technical: 70 points.** Includes: bidder qualifications/certificates (e.g. ISO27001, ISO9001, CCRC, ITSS) up to 2; project team and service (e.g. project manager with CISP, integration, network cert.; ≥3 CISP or mid-level security engineers; on-site service commitment) up to 5; similar project cases (from 2022) up to 6; product capability (e.g. software copyright, course/competition support, AI digital human vendor with national standard) up to 9; technical parameters (▲ items with proof; non-▲ full compliance; negative deviation deductions) up to 10; on-site function demo (items marked #) up to 10; technical scheme up to 10; implementation scheme up to 10; after-sales scheme up to 6; emergency service scheme up to 2.
- **Core product:** Cyberspace security teaching platform. Same-brand core product from different bidders: count as one bidder; highest score (or lower price if tied) recommended.

### VI–VII. Other Notes; Detailed Review Appendices

- Bidders shall send representatives to participate and clarify in writing as required. Obviously high or below-cost prices may be challenged; failure to justify may result in rejection and referral to finance authorities.
- **Appendix 1 (Compliance):** Checklist of 11 items (bond, authorization, seal, qualification, price, period, name, no same-LR/affiliates, validity, no material departure, other).
- **Appendix 2 (Economic):** Price score formula and benchmark definition.
- **Appendix 3 (Commercial/technical):** Breakdown of the 70-point criteria above.
