<!-- id: p000058 type: paragraph -->
(1) This project implements electronic bidding. Suppliers must log in to the Government Procurement Cloud platform to apply for procurement documents and prepare response documents using the Government Procurement Cloud electronic bidding client, and shall bear all costs related to bidding.

<!-- id: p000059 type: paragraph -->
(2) Before bid opening, each supplier shall ensure it is formally registered and on file as a supplier on the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Government Procurement Network, and complete application for a CA digital certificate. Any consequences such as inability to bid or bid failure due to not being registered/on file or not obtaining a CA digital certificate shall be borne by the supplier.

<!-- id: p000060 type: paragraph -->
(3) Suppliers intending to participate in Xinjiang-region electronic bid opening and evaluation may visit the official website of the Xinjiang Digital Certificate Authentication Center (https://www.xjca.com.cn/) or download the “Xinjiang Government Services” app to apply. For consultation, please contact the Xinjiang CA service hotline 0991-2819290.

<!-- id: p000061 type: paragraph -->
(4) Suppliers may go to the download section of the Xinjiang Government Procurement Network (http://www.ccgp-xinjiang.gov.cn/) to download the Government Procurement Cloud electronic bidding client. After installation, suppliers may log in via account/password or CA to prepare response documents. When using the Government Procurement Cloud electronic bidding client, it is recommended to use WIN7 or above. For issues, call the Government Procurement Cloud customer service hotline 95763.

<!-- id: p000062 type: paragraph -->
(5) This project adopts non-face-to-face bid opening. Suppliers must upload the encrypted electronic response documents on the Government Procurement Cloud platform via CA before the bid deadline. Note: For technical operation consultation regarding the non-face-to-face bid opening and evaluation system, suppliers may self-check via https://edu.zcygov.cn/luban/xinjiang-e-biding, or self-check via the Government Procurement Cloud Help Center FAQs and operation walkthrough videos at https://service.zcygov.cn/#/help under “Project Procurement” → “Operation Process – Electronic Bidding” → “Government Procurement Project Electronic Transaction Management Operation Guide – Supplier,” and for issues not resolved through self-check, obtain support via the DingTalk group and Government Procurement Cloud online customer service.

<!-- id: p000063 type: paragraph -->
(6) Before bid opening, suppliers must configure their computer browser in advance (360 Browser or Google Chrome is recommended). At bid opening, please use the CA token used to produce the encrypted electronic response document to decrypt and confirm the quotation. The decryption time for response documents in this project is set to 30 minutes; if decryption cannot be completed normally due to the supplier’s own reasons, the consequences shall be borne by the supplier.

<!-- id: p000064 type: paragraph -->
(7) On the day response documents are opened, suppliers do not need to arrive at the bid opening site; they only need to complete interactive steps such as remote decryption, bid opening announcement, inquiry and clarification, online multi-round quotation, and result publication through the “non-face-to-face” bid opening hall on the Government Procurement Cloud platform. Suppliers must use a “CA token” that can correctly decrypt the response documents to complete remote decryption within the prescribed time; if the supplier fails to decrypt, decryption fails, or decryption times out, it shall be deemed that the supplier has withdrawn its response document.

<!-- id: p000065 type: paragraph -->
(8) Response documents uploaded late or not uploaded to the designated location will not be accepted by the purchaser.

Chapter 5 Award (Determination of the Winning Bid)

<!-- id: p000280 type: paragraph -->
15. Award Criteria

<!-- id: p000281 type: paragraph -->
15.1 The evaluation panel shall use the comprehensive scoring method to comprehensively score bidders’ bid documents and quotations. The comprehensive scoring method refers to the evaluation method in which the bid documents meet all substantive requirements of the bidding documents, and the bidder with the highest score according to the quantified indicators of the evaluation factors is the winning-candidate bidder.

<!-- id: p000282 type: paragraph -->
The price score shall be calculated using the low-price-first method, i.e., the lowest bid quotation that meets the requirements of the bidding documents is the evaluation benchmark price, and its price score is the full score. The price scores of other bidders are calculated uniformly using the following formula:

<!-- id: p000283 type: paragraph -->
Bid quotation score = (evaluation benchmark price / bid quotation) * 100% * price score value

<!-- id: p000284 type: paragraph -->
Total evaluation score = F1*A1 + F2*A2 + ……Fn*AN

<!-- id: p000285 type: paragraph -->
F1, F2……Fn are the scores of each evaluation factor; A1, A2……An are the weights of each evaluation factor (A1+A2+……+An=1).

<!-- id: p000286 type: paragraph -->
During bid evaluation, the highest quotation and the lowest quotation in the quotations shall not be removed.

<!-- id: p000287 type: paragraph -->
Based on this principle, the evaluation panel ranks from high to low and recommends 3 bidders as winning candidates to the Purchaser, or rejects all bidders; the Purchaser, based on the experts’ recommendations and suggestions, determines and announces the final winning contractor.

<!-- id: p000288 type: paragraph -->
15.2 In principle, the first-ranked bidder shall be determined as the successful bidder; if any of the following circumstances occurs, the recommended second-ranked bidder may also be determined as the successful bidder:

<!-- id: p000289 type: paragraph -->
15.2.1 The first-ranked winning candidate waives the award;

<!-- id: p000290 type: paragraph -->
15.2.2 The first-ranked winning candidate states it cannot perform the contract due to force majeure.

<!-- id: p000291 type: paragraph -->
15.2.3 Within 30 days of receiving the Notice of Award, the first-ranked candidate fails to sign the contract as scheduled. If the second-ranked candidate cannot meet this requirement (while meeting other award conditions), the Purchaser will choose to conduct technical and commercial evaluation with the third-ranked winning candidate.

<!-- id: p000292 type: paragraph -->
15.3 The evaluation panel has no obligation to provide bidders with any explanations relating to tendering or evaluation.

<!-- id: p000293 type: paragraph -->
15.4 Before determining and announcing the final successful bidder, the Purchaser may, when deemed necessary, investigate and verify matters it considers necessary to understand or verify.

<!-- id: p000294 type: paragraph -->
15.5 If it is determined that the bidder will unconditionally and satisfactorily perform the contract, the evaluation panel will conduct a similar review of the qualifications of the next potential winning bidder.

<!-- id: p000295 type: paragraph -->
16. Public Notice of Results

<!-- id: p000296 type: paragraph -->
For projects that must be tendered in accordance with law, the tenderer shall publish the winning candidates on the Xinjiang Government Procurement Network.

<!-- id: p000850 type: paragraph -->
1.1  To protect the rights and interests of all parties to the greatest extent, the evaluation panel shall conduct evaluation strictly in accordance with the requirements of the tender documents and prepare an evaluation report. Evaluators must strictly comply with confidentiality requirements, must not disclose any information related to the evaluation, must not solicit or accept bribes, and must not participate in any activities that affect the evaluation.

<!-- id: p000851 type: paragraph -->
1.2  During evaluation, the evaluation panel shall, against the conditions and standards stipulated in the tender documents, review, compare, and assess the compliance, completeness, and validity of each bidder’s bid documents.

If any deviation from the tender document requirements is found, the deviation shall be verified as necessary and explained in the working papers; if it constitutes a substantive deviation or meets the conditions for an invalid response, the bidder shall be questioned and allowed to make a statement and defense, but the bidder is not allowed to supplement, amend, or withdraw substantive deviation clauses.

<!-- id: p000852 type: paragraph -->
1.3  Evaluation principles:

<!-- id: p000853 type: paragraph -->

<!-- id: p000854 type: paragraph -->
1.3.2 The evaluation panel shall, based on the comprehensive scoring results, recommend 3 or more winning candidate bidders in descending order of evaluation score and prepare an evaluation report. Where evaluation scores are the same, recommendations shall be made in ascending order of the final quotation (from low to high). Where both the evaluation score and the final quotation are the same, the evaluation panel shall determine the ranking and recommendation order either according to the relative merits of technical indicators or by drawing lots.

5.2  Detailed review

<!-- id: p000918 type: paragraph -->
For bid documents that pass the preliminary review, the bid evaluation committee will further review and compare the bid documents according to the scoring criteria.

<!-- id: p000919 type: paragraph -->
5.3  Scoring method

<!-- id: p000920 type: paragraph -->
5.3.1 Economic section: 30 points; commercial and technical section: 70 points.

<!-- id: p000921 type: paragraph -->
5.3.2 Price adjustment principles

<!-- id: p000922 type: paragraph -->
1) The bidder’s quotation must include all contents within the scope of supply.

<!-- id: p000923 type: paragraph -->
2) The bidder must, according to the requirements of the tender documents and the technical condition of the product, list the spare parts required during the quality warranty period and their prices, and include the spare parts cost in the total bid price. If the provided product does not require spare parts or spare parts will be provided free of charge, it shall be stated in the bid documents. Otherwise, it will be treated as an omission.

<!-- id: p000924 type: paragraph -->
3) If the bidder’s quotation has omissions, the highest price of that item among other bidders’ quotations shall be added to the bidder’s total bid price.

<!-- id: p000925 type: paragraph -->
4) The adjusted price will be used as the bidder’s evaluation price. Economic scores for each bidder will be calculated based on the evaluation price.

<!-- id: p000926 type: paragraph -->
5.3.3 The economic section has no base price and the quotation score is calculated according to the following standards:

<!-- id: p000927 type: paragraph -->
1) The benchmark price is a reasonable low price, i.e., the lowest bid quotation that meets the tender document requirements is the evaluation benchmark price, and its price score is full marks. The price scores of other bidders are calculated uniformly according to the following formula:

<!-- id: p000928 type: paragraph -->
Bid quotation score = (evaluation benchmark price／bid quotation) × price score value × 100%, with the result retained to two decimal places.

<!-- id: p000929 type: paragraph -->
2) If the calculated score is negative, it will be counted as zero.

<!-- id: p000930 type: paragraph -->
VI. Other matters for attention

<!-- id: p000931 type: paragraph -->
6.1  When bidding, the bidder shall send a representative to participate at the designated location. The bidder’s personnel must promptly explain and

<!-- id: p000932 type: paragraph -->
clarify the contents of the bid documents, and confirm them by signing in written form, etc.

<!-- id: p000933 type: paragraph -->
6.2  If, during evaluation, a bidder’s quotation is found to be obviously higher than its market quotation or lower than cost, the bidder shall be required to provide a written explanation and relevant supporting materials. If the bidder cannot reasonably explain the reasons and provide supporting materials, the evaluation panel shall treat the bidder’s procurement bid documents as invalid; meanwhile, the procurement organizing body shall report the situation to the finance authority at the same level, and may list the bidder in the roster of bad bidders as appropriate.
